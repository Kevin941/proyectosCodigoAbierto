<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This document explains how to develop your own web applications using
the Ontopia Navigator Framework. It describes the architecture and main
concepts of the Navigator Framework, how to configure the Navigator, and
introduces the tag libraries used in web application development.
</p>


<p>
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the use of the
operating system under which the navigator is to run, as well as the
basics of HTML. Working knowledge of topic maps is also assumed.

<h2>
<a name="N10026">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>
The idea behind the Ontopia Navigator Framework is that although the
Omnigator can display any topic map and has a nice user interface, it
is unlikely that all those building web sites using topic maps will
want to use the Omnigator as the web site presenting their topic maps
to the world.  Most likely, those building topic map web sites will
wish to have them look as much like ordinary web sites as possible.
</p>


<p>
Using the navigator framework it is easy to develop new topic
map-based web sites, and these web sites need not look anything like
the Omnigator. In fact, they can have any user interface at all. The
navigator framework does not generate any HTML; this is left for your
web application to do. The result is that you have complete control
over the layout and structure of your application.
</p>


<p>
This document will show you how to create web applications using the
Ontopia Navigator Framework. This introductory section will explain
the architecture and stucture of the framework, while the following
section will show the basics of making web applications. The final
sections covers some of the more advanced areas of the framework.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10034">1.1. The architecture of the framework</a>
</h3>



<p>
The Ontopia Navigator Framework is based on the J2EE (Java 2,
Enterprise Edition) platform, and should run in any compliant J2EE
application server which supports JSP 1.1 or higher. It has been
tested with many application servers, and should not cause problems
when tried on a new server.
</p>


<p>
Web pages written using the navigator framework are written as JSP
(JavaServer Pages). JSP is a Java technology that lets you write web
pages as HTML with embedded Java code. The Java code is evaluated to
produce either output in the page, or desirable side-effects on the
server (such as updates in a topic map or a database). JSP pages can
also use tags implemented in Java, which can produce output and
control the execution of pages. JSP is easy to learn, efficient in
use, and creates well-performing web applications.
</p>


<p>
The navigator framework mainly consists of a set of tag libraries
that make it possible to write JSP pages that consist of nothing but
HTML and JSP tags. This makes the pages easy to read and maintain; the
tags being something like an 'XSLT for topic maps'. The application
when written consists of a set of JSP pages, plus possibly some Java
classes that have been plugged in to provide extra functionality.
</p>


<p>
When running, the architecture of the web application is as shown
below.
</p>


<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 1. A Navigator Application</b>
</p>


<p>
The navigator framework uses the topic map registry to access the
topic maps it works with. This means that it is completely independent
of where the topic maps come from and which topic map implementation
they use. How to configure the registry is explained in
<cite><a href="config.html">The Ontopia Navigator -
Configuration Guide</a></cite>.
</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10058">1.2. The tag libraries</a>
</h3>



<p>
The tags in the navigator tag libraries operate in an execution
context. This context contains a number of variable bindings, which
are mappings from variable names to values. These values are always
collections of objects, which may be topic map objects, strings, or
other kinds of objects.
</p>


<p>
A JSP page written using these tag libraries works by extracting
information from the current topic map and storing it in variables in
the execution context. The page then uses the information in the
variables to generate the content that makes up the rendered page that
the user will see.
</p>


<p>
The tags have been separated into two different tag libraries,
organized by the functionality they provide:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>The 'tolog' tag library</dt>
<dd>This tag library makes up nearly the entire framework and
consists of tags which use tolog queries to extract information from
the topic map and produce output. There are tags for setting
variables, doing tests and loops, and writing output.</dd>
<dt>The 'template' tag library</dt>
<dd>The template tags provide a simple templating system that can be
used to avoid having to add repetitive formatting HTML to all JSP
pages. These tags are not in any way topic map-aware, and the rest of
the framework does not require them, so if you want to use a different
template system, you can.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
The document <cite><a href="tolog-taglib.html">The Navigator
Tag Libraries: Reference Documentation</a></cite> contains
detailed information about all the tags. Please consult it to find
tags not mentioned in this tutorial, and more comprehensive
information about those mentioned.  The following section gives a
tutorial on how to use the tags in these tag libraries.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1008A">1.3. Finding topics and topic maps</a>
</h3>



<p>
The navigator framework uses the topic map registry of the topic map
engine to find out what topic maps are available, and also to look up
individual topic maps by ID. The IDs are assigned by the registry, and
for topic maps loaded from files they are the file name (without
path). For topic maps residing in the RDBMS backend the ID will be
<tt class="literal">"RDBMS-XXX"</tt>, where <tt class="symbol">XXX</tt> is the ID
of the topic map in the <tt class="symbol">tm_topic_map</tt> table. Generally,
you can use the Omnigator to find the ID of a topic map, by looking at
the <tt class="symbol">tm</tt> parameter in the URI of the topic map page.
</p>


<p>
How to configure the topic map registry is explained in
<cite><a href="config.html">The Ontopia Navigator -
Configuration Guide</a></cite>, in the section on the
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file. If you have bought the
engine product you can also find more information in the javadoc of
the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.entry.XMLConfigSource</tt>
class.
</p>


<p>
Note that throughout the navigator framework topic map objects are
identified by their object IDs. These are inserted into links by the
framework, and later read from HTTP requests by the framework. This
enables one page to tell another which topic to display. How to do
this will be explained later in this tutorial.
</p>







<h2>
<a name="N100B3">2. Writing the example application</a>
</h2>



<p>
In this section we will create a web application for the Free XML
Tools topic map and show how it works. You can find the source code to
it in the <tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/xmltools</tt>
directory in your installation. Feel free to look at the source code
while reading this section, and also to change and play around with it
in any way you like. (After you've changed a JSP page you need only
reload it in your browser to have it recompiled.)
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N100BE">2.1. The structure of the application</a>
</h3>



<p>
The web application must necessarily mirror the structure of the
information in the topic map, so we'll start out by looking at the
topic map. A useful tool for getting an overview of a topic map is the
statistics plug-in to the Omnigator.
</p>


<p>
The statistics plug-in shows us that the Free XML Tools topic map
contains categories/subcategories, products, standards, and vendors.
There are associations between products, and from categories,
standards, and vendors to products. Clearly, the products are what the
site revolves around, and the other topic types provide ways of
finding the products.
</p>


<p>
The best way to organize the site seems to be to have a start page,
with links to pages containing lists of categories, products,
standards, and vendors. The pages with lists can contain links to each
individual instance, which again can have links to the topics it is
associated with. This structure is shown in the diagram below. There
will also be a number of cross-links within this hierarchy, shown at
the bottom of the diagram.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="sample-app-struct.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 2. Site structure</b>
</p>


<p>
This should give us enough to work with, so let's move on to writing
the actual application.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N100DB">2.2. Setting up the application</a>
</h3>



<p>
To create your web application, create a directory named
<tt>xmltools</tt> inside the <tt>webapps</tt>
directory of your Tomcat installation. The next step is to create a
file called <tt>index.jsp</tt> inside it, with the
contents shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Hello, world!</b>
</p>



<code>
<pre>

&lt;title&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first JSP page.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</code>



<p>
Now we have a web page, but Tomcat will not find our web application
before we add a <tt>web.xml</tt> file, so the next step is
to do that. Start by making a <tt>WEB-INF</tt> directory
inside the new <tt>xmltools</tt> directory.  Then create a
file named <tt>web.xml</tt> inside the
<tt>WEB-INF</tt> directory. This will contain the
configuration information needed by the navigator framework. The
contents of this file are shown below, with explanations in comments.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A minimal web.xml file</b>
</p>



<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app
          PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN"
          "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_2.dtd"&gt;

&lt;web-app&gt;

  &lt;display-name&gt;Free XML Tools&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
    A web site with information about free XML tools.
  &lt;/description&gt;

    &lt;session-config&gt;
      &lt;session-timeout&gt;30&lt;/session-timeout&gt;    
    &lt;/session-config&gt;

    &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
      &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.html&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
      &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
    &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;

&lt;/web-app&gt;

</pre>




<p>
This file contains references to our configuration files, so we need
to add those. First, create the
<tt>xmltools/WEB-INF/config</tt> directory, and create a
file called <tt>application.xml</tt> inside it, with the
contents shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The application.xml file</b>
</p>



<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;configuration type="application"&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;property name="allowLoadOnRequest" value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;

  &lt;classmap&gt;
    &lt;class shortcut="nameComparator"
           fullname="net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav.utils.comparators.NameComparator"/&gt;
  &lt;/classmap&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;

</pre>


<p>
This tells the framework that it should load topic maps whenever they
are requested by users (<tt class="symbol">allowLoadOnRequest</tt>) and what
Java class it should use to sort the names of topics.
</p>



<p>
Now, finally, you can start the Tomcat server. If you already had it
running, please restart it. Then connect to <a href="http://localhost:8080/xmltools/">http://localhost:8080/xmltools/</a>,
where you should see the page you just wrote. The server will compile
the JSP page the first time you load it, and so that first time will
be a little slow, but after that it will load instantly.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10135">2.3. The start page</a>
</h3>



<p>
We are now ready to write the application, and can start with the
start page: <tt>index.jsp</tt>. The source code of this
could be as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The index.jsp page</b>
</p>



<code>
<pre>

&lt;title&gt;Free XML Tools&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Free XML Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a site about free XML tools, which you can find organized by:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="standards.jsp"&gt;the standards they support&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="vendors.jsp"&gt;the vendors that make them&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="categories.jsp"&gt;the categories they belong to&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="products.jsp"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</code>



<p>
Since this page can be written statically we do not yet make any use
of the tag libraries, but instead write a pure HTML page.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1014D">2.4. The standards page</a>
</h3>



<p>
The next step is to write the page that lists all the standards in the
topic map. We start by creating a skeleton of the
<tt>standards.jsp</tt> page, as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A skeleton standards page</b>
</p>



<code>
<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="xmltools-tm.xtm"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The standards&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The standards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here you can find all the standards supported or used by the tools
on this site:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;%-- more code to go here --%&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;
</pre>
</code>



<p>
The line beginning with <tt class="symbol">&lt;%@</tt> is a declaration that
makes the tag <tt class="symbol">tolog</tt> library available in the page,
with the given prefix. The <tt class="symbol">tolog:context</tt> tag sets up
the execution context, and tells the framework what topic map we are
working with.  The <tt class="symbol">topicmap</tt> attribute contains the ID
of the topic map, as defined by the topic map registry. If the topic
map has not already been loaded when this page is accessed, the
<tt class="symbol">tolog:context</tt> tag will do it for us. (Note that this
depends on the <tt class="symbol">allowLoadOnRequest</tt> property in the
application configuration file, which is why we set that to
<tt class="symbol">true</tt> above.)
</p>


<p>
The next step is to list all the standards. Or, to put it the topic
map way, we need to find all the instances of the class standard,
which is represented by the topic 'standard'. The way to do this is to
use a tolog query which finds all standards, and use it with the
<tt class="symbol">tolog:foreach</tt> tag, which will loop over all the
results returned by the query.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($STD, TMTT_Standard) order by $STD?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Yet another standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</code>


<p>
This will give us one row for each standard, but all the rows will
read the same, so we need to somehow output the names of the standards
we've found. Inside the <tt class="symbol">tolog:foreach</tt> tag, all the
variables defined by the query (in this case only
<tt class="symbol">STD</tt>) will be available. So we can use the
<tt class="symbol">tolog:out</tt> tag, which can output topics (by picking
their most suitable name). Adding this gives us the code below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($STD, TMTT_Standard) order by $STD?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="STD"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</code>


<p>
The next step is to make a link to the page for each standard, which
is of course easy, but we also need to pass the ID of the topic for
the standard to that page. This can be done with an HTTP request
parameter, and we can use the <tt class="symbol">tolog:id</tt> tag to get the
ID, as shown below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($STD, TMTT_Standard) order by $STD?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="standard.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="STD"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="STD"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</code>



<h3>
<a name="sect-std-page">2.5. The page for each standard</a>
</h3>



<p>
We are now ready to write the pages that display information about the
individual standards (<tt>standard.jsp</tt>). This page is
slightly different in that it needs to get the ID of the topic from
<tt class="symbol">id</tt> parameter of the HTTP request, and then look up
that topic. Note that this ID is the ID of the topic that was put into
the URI by the <tt class="symbol">tolog:id</tt> tag. Below is the JSP source
skeleton for this page.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="xmltools-tm.xtm"&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="standard" reqparam="id"/&gt;

&lt;title&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="standard"/&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="standard"/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;%-- more code to go here --%&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;
</pre>
</code>


<p>
This page is rather like the previous one, except that we are now
using the <tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> tag to pick out the topic from
the request parameter (using the <tt class="symbol">reqparam</tt> attribute),
and setting it into a variable we name <tt class="symbol">standard</tt>. This
lets us use the <tt class="symbol">tolog:out</tt> tag to output the name of
the standard at the top of the page.
</p>


<p>
Now the question is what more we can display to the user about the
standard they have chosen. The topic map contains the following
information about standards:
</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>Occurrences of the types specification, link collection, site
about, and home page.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Associations to products that use the standard.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Associations to products that implement the standard.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>
The most reasonable way to do this seems to be to make a table of the
occurrences, and then to list the associated products below the table.
The code below produces the table of occurrences.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
&lt;!-- OCCURRENCES --&gt;
&lt;tolog:if query="occurrence(%standard%, $OCC)?"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tolog:foreach query="select $OCCTYPE, $URI from
                        occurrence(%standard%, $OCC),
                        type($OCC, $OCCTYPE),
                        resource($OCC, $URI)
                      order by $OCCTYPE, $URI?"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="OCCTYPE"/&gt;:
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;tolog:out var="URI"/&gt;"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="URI"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/tolog:if&gt;
</pre>
</code>


<p>
We start out by checking if there are any occurrences of this topic,
since we don't want to produce the <tt class="symbol">table</tt> element if
there are none. We do this using the <tt class="symbol">tolog:if</tt> tag,
which will only execute its contents if the query returns at least one
row. Note that in this query we need to refer to the current standard,
which is in the <tt class="symbol">standard</tt> variable. We do this by
using the <tt class="symbol">%standard%</tt> syntax in the query.
</p>


<p>
After that, all we need to do is to do a query that finds all the
occurrences, their types, and their URIs, and we can loop over them
with <tt class="symbol">tolog:foreach</tt> and output them. Notice that the
<tt class="symbol">tolog:out</tt> tag just as happy to display the URI as it
is to display topics.
</p>


<p>
The next step is to list all the topics that implement the standard,
which is done by the code below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;tolog:if query="TMAT_StandardImplemented(%standard% : TMTT_Standard,
                                          $PRODUCT : TMTT_Product)?"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This standard has been implemented by the following products:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;tolog:foreach query="TMAT_StandardImplemented(%standard% : TMTT_Standard,
                                          $PRODUCT : TMTT_Product)
                      order by $PRODUCT?"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="product.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="PRODUCT"/&gt;"
        &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="PRODUCT"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/tolog:if&gt;</pre>
</code>


<p>
There's nothing really new here, so we won't go into the details of
how it works.
</p>


<p>
Finally, we list all the products that use this standard. This is very
similar to what we did above, as you can see from the code below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;tolog:if query="TMAT_StandardsUse(%standard% : TMAR_UsedIn,

<h2>
<a name="N1020B">3. More advanced subjects</a>
</h2>



<p>
This section covers some of the more advanced aspects of writing web
applications with the navigator framework. You do not need to
understand these to write applications with the framework, but the
features presented here can make the job easier, and can also lead to
a superior result.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10213">3.1. Grouping</a>
</h3>



<p>
Let's imagine that we wanted to create a list of all vendors, and that
for each vendor we wanted to list all its products. We could do this
with two nested foreach-tags, an outer one for the vendors, and an
inner one for the products. However, this requires us to use two
queries instead of one (even though we can select both in a single
query). This isn't good for performance, since it means that if there
are 100 vendors, the inner query will be run 100 times. So instead of
running 1 query, we run 101. 
</p>


<p>
The other approach would be to do a single query that finds both, and
then using it in a single foreach-loop. However, if we want to create
a nested HTML list we now have to be able to tell when the vendor in
this iteration is different from that in the previous one, and the tag
library doesn't support that. What it <em>does</em>
support is grouping, which solves this problem quite easily.
</p>


<p>
The code below shows how to do the outer loop.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="xmltools-tm.xtm"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The vendors&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The vendors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="TMAT_ProductVendor($VENDOR : TMAR_Creator,
                                             $PRODUCT : TMTT_Product)
                        order by $VENDOR, $PRODUCT?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="vendor.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="VENDOR"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="VENDOR"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;%-- inner loop goes here --%&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>
</code>


<p>
The next step is to make the outer foreach-loop only iterate once for
each vendor. This we do by adding a <tt class="symbol">groupBy</tt> attribute
to it. After this, we need to add a new foreach-loop for the products,
but we don't give it a query, since it's going to use the parent's
query. The result is shown below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="TMAT_ProductVendor($VENDOR : TMAR_Creator,
                                             $PRODUCT : TMTT_Product)
                        order by $VENDOR, $PRODUCT?" groupBy="VENDOR"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="vendor.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="VENDOR"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="VENDOR"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;tolog:foreach&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="product.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="PRODUCT"/&gt;"
              &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="PRODUCT"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
</code>


<p>
Note that it is possible group on more than one variable. This allows
you to use multiple variables set in the query in the outer loop. For
example, if the VENDOR's subject identifier is in the variable
<tt class="symbol">VENDOR-ID</tt>, the setting <tt class="symbol">groupBy</tt> to
<tt class="symbol">VENDOR VENDOR-ID</tt> gives access to both variables in
the outer loop.
</p>


<p>
Note that it is also possible to have several levels of
<tt class="symbol">foreach</tt> tags, where new variables are grouped on each
level. For example, you can group on <tt class="symbol">COUNTRY</tt> in the
outermost loop, then group on <tt class="symbol">PROVINCE</tt> in the next
loop, and finally iterate over <tt class="symbol">CITY</tt> in the third
loop.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1024C">3.2. Reusing code fragments with inclusion</a>
</h3>



<p>
Quite often applications contain fragments of code that with only
minor variations are repeated over and over again. JSP provides three
different mechanisms for dealing with this: static includes, dynamic
includes, and (in JSP 2.0) tag files.
</p>


<p>
Static includes are the simplest mechanism. They let you reference
another JSP file, and the effect is as though you had copied the other
file and pasted it into the first file. This means that the Navigator
Framework variables used in the parent file will all be visible in the
included file. The syntax is as follows:
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;%@ include file="relativeFragment.jsp" %&gt;</pre>
</code>

<p>
The other way to include a fragment is to use a dynamic include, with
the <tt class="symbol">jsp:include</tt> tag, which belongs to the
<tt class="symbol">jsp</tt> tag library, which is part of the JSP standard,
and does not need to be declared. Dynamic includes are different from
static ones in that the included file is considered a separate page
(so you need to declare all tag libraries in it), and also in that it
is checked for updates each time it is referenced. The variables set
in the parent file will be visible in the referenced file. The example
below shows the syntax.
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;jsp:include page="relativeFragment.jsp"/&gt;</pre>
</code>


<p>
The final and most powerful way to make reusable fragments is with tag
files, which let you create your own tags using JSP fragments. This
feature is only available in JSP 2.0, however, so whether it works for
you depends on what server you use. It will <em>not</em>
work in Tomcat 4.x, for example; you must use Tomcat 5.x. For more
information, see <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/11/14/tagfiles.html">this
java.net tutorial</a>.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10271">3.3. Rendering the ancestors of a topic</a>
</h3>



<p>
A common requirement is to have a topic that is part of some
hierarchy, and to want to show all the ancestors of that topic in
order as you go up the tree. This is not possible in a single tolog
query, because although the query will easily find all ancestors, it
will not be able to rank them by distance to the starting topic.
The solution is to use a recursive code fragment.
</p>


<p>
Imagine that you have a category in a taxonomy in the variable named
<tt class="symbol">category</tt> and you want to show all its ancestor
categories all the way up to the root in a breadcrumb-like fashion.
To do that, write the following in your JSP file:
</p>


<pre>&lt;jsp:include page="category-tree.jsp"/&gt;</pre>


<p>
Note that you have to use <tt class="symbol">jsp:include</tt> here, since a
static include would cause an infinite recursion, as static includes
are processed at compile-time. To make this work we also need
<tt class="symbol">category-tree.jsp</tt>, which looks as follows:
</p>


<pre>
&lt;%-- must redeclare taglibs inside the fragment --%&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog'%&gt;

&lt;%-- we move on to the parent of this topic --%&gt;
&lt;tolog:if test="broader-narrower(%PARENT% : narrower, $PARENT : broader)?"&gt;
 &lt;%-- the parent is the new topic --%&gt;
 &lt;tolog:set var="topic" query="$T = %PARENT%?"/&gt; 

 &lt;%-- render all the ancestors --%&gt;
 &lt;jsp:include page="category-tree.jsp"/&gt;

 &lt;%-- render the separator --%&gt;
 |
&lt;/tolog:if&gt;

&lt;%-- we render the topic after all its ancestors --%&gt;
&lt;a href="category.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="topic"&gt;"
  &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="topic"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>





<h3>
<a name="N10291">3.4. Using dynamic values with the tag libraries</a>
</h3>



<p>
Sometimes one may want to get the values to be used with the tag
libraries from Java code, for example because they may be retrieved
from request parameters or configuration files. This can be done quite
easily using the <tt class="symbol">&lt;%= ... %&gt;</tt> construct. Here is an
JSP fragment which shows you how could use this:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using dynamic attribute values</b>
</p>



<code>
<pre>
  &lt;%
    String searchFor = request.getParameter("search_for");
    String query = "topic-name($TOPIC, $N), " +
                   "value-like($N, \"" + searchFor + "\")?";
  %&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="&lt;%= query %&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="TOPIC"/&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;  
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</code>




<h3>
<a name="N102A7">3.5. Understanding lexical scope</a>
</h3>



<p>
One key aspect of the tag libraries that has not been discussed so far
is that of variable scope. This has nothing to do with scope as in
topic maps, but is the familiar concept of scope in programming
language theory. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(programming)">scope</a>
in this sense is the region of the source code in which the binding of
a variable is visible.  In other words: when you use
<tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> to assign a value to the variable
<tt class="symbol">foo</tt> its scope is the part of the source code where
you can get the value of <tt class="symbol">foo</tt>.
</p>


<p>
The tag libraries have lexical scope, also known as static scope,
which means that every variable is only available within a fixed
region of the source code, and that you can work out what that region
is just by reading the source code. It does not depend on runtime
behaviour at all.
</p>


<p>
In the tag libraries, some of the tags establish new lexical scopes
(such as <tt class="symbol">tolog:context</tt>, <tt class="symbol">tolog:if</tt>, 
<tt class="symbol">tolog:when</tt>, <tt class="symbol">tolog:otherwise</tt>, and
<tt class="symbol">tolog:foreach</tt>) while others are neutral with respect
to scope. The tag library reference documents which tags create new
lexical scopes.
</p>


<p>
So to find out where a variable binding is visible, find the nearest
ancestor tag of the <tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> tag that establishes a
lexical scope. The variable will be visible within that tag, but not
outside it. Whether a variable with the same name already exists
within an outer scope makes no difference.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="sect-rdbms">3.6. Using the RDBMS backend</a>
</h3>



<p>
To use the Navigator Framework with the RDBMS backend, the main thing
that needs to be done is to configure the
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file correctly, as described in the
configuration guide. However, since the RDBMS backend has to support
transactions, there are some rules for how to use the APIs that one
can freely break with the in-memory engine, but which will cause
problems if broken when using the RDBMS backend. This section attempts
to explain what these are.
</p>


<p>
When using the RDBMS backend, Ontopia maintains a pool of topic map
stores, and everything that is done with a topic map is done
using one of these stores. For Ontopia to be able to maintain
the pool properly, topic maps have to be explicitly returned to the
pool. This is done by calling the <tt class="methodname">close</tt>
method on the <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapStoreIF</tt>
interface. Note that if you use the tag libraries this happens
automatically for the topic maps retrieved by the
<tt class="symbol">context</tt> tag.
</p>


<p>
There are some issues to be aware of here, however:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>Any objects retrieved through
    <tt class="classname">ContextUtils</tt> (see <a href="#sect-context-utils">section
        4.1</a>) come from the transaction
    maintained by the framework for the purpose of rendering the page,
    and will be taken care of by the <tt class="symbol">context</tt>
    tag.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>Any topic maps opened explicitly, for example using
    <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapRepositoryIF</tt>, will get
    their own transactions. This means that trying to pass objects
    from these transactions into the context maintained by the JSP
    tags (for example as parameters to a tolog query) will
    <em>not</em> work. Bizarre and hard-to-reproduce bugs
    are likely to be the result of this.</p>

    
<p>Also, any topic maps opened explicitly will also have to be
    closed or returned explicitly. The <tt class="symbol">context</tt> tag
    cannot take care of this, because it is not aware of these
    transactions.</p>
  
</li>
</ul>


<h4>
<a name="sect-txn-jsp-1.1">3.6.1. The joys of JSP 1.1</a>
</h4>



<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd>
  
<p>This section only applies to JSP 1.1 (which is an old version;
  today JSP 1.2 and 2.0 are the most common). If you use JSP 1.1 you
  <em>absolutely must</em> read this; if you don't, you
  can just skip this.</p>

</dd>
</dl>


<p>
JSP 1.2 introduced the
<tt class="interfacename">javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TryCatchFinally</tt>
interface, which allows a tag to catch exceptions thrown in its body
or perform actions even if exceptions have been thrown. The
<tt class="symbol">context</tt> tag implements this interface, as this is
absolutely necessary to avoid running out of stores in the store pool
when exceptions are thrown (as occasionally they are). 
</p>


<p>
Implementing this interface causes problems for JSP 1.1, of course,
since the JSP 1.1 jar files do not contain a class file for this
interface. This is worked around by means of a special jar file named
<tt>config/jsp-11/jsp12-compat.jar</tt>, which is included
in the Ontopia distribution. This means the tags can run, but does
<em>not</em> provide the desired try/catch/finally
behaviour, since JSP 1.1 does not support this. The only known
solution to this problem in JSP 1.1 is to manually add a try/finally
to each JSP page.
</p>





<h2>
<a name="N1033B">4. Performing common tasks</a>
</h2>



<p>
This section describes how to solve some commonly occurring problems
when writing applications with the tag libraries.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="sect-context-utils">4.1. Accessing the values of variables from Java code</a>
</h3>



<p>
Sometimes one wants to use the tags to collect information from the
topic map, and then process it in ways that only Java code can do.
This can easily be done using the utility class
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav2.utils.ContextUtils</tt>,
which has utility methods for accessing the variables in the context.
</p>


<p>
Below is shown a code snippet that illustrates how to use this class.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using ContextUtils</b>
</p>



<code>
<pre>

&lt;tolog:set var="picture" query="illustration(%topic%, $URI)?"/&gt;

&lt;%-- And now we want to use Java to get at the illustration --%&gt;

&lt;%
  String ill = (String) ContextUtils.getSingleValue("picture", pageContext);
  // do useful things with 'ill'
%&gt;
</pre>
</code>




<h3>
<a name="N1035E">4.2. Integration with JSP attributes</a>
</h3>



<p>
The Navigator Framework supports accessing and setting page attributes
in a way that is similar to how <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/reference/techart/unifiedEL.html">the
JSP Expression Language</a> works. Page attributes can be
accessed by name (and bean property) from the <tt class="symbol">var</tt> attribute
of the <tt class="symbol">tolog:out</tt>, <tt class="symbol">tolog:oid</tt>, and
<tt class="symbol">tolog:id</tt> tags. This makes it easy to use the
Navigator Framework together with other tag libraries, such as the
JSTL tag libraries, and it also makes it possible to use the Navigator
Framework with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach.
</p>


<p>
How it works is perhaps best shown with an example, shown below.
</p>


<pre>&lt;!-- The JSP page is run by a front controller servlet
     which creates a model object and registers it as the JSP attribute model.
     The model object has a getCurrentTopic method, returning the current
     topic.
--&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="model.currentTopic"/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

</pre>


<p>
Basically, how this works is that variable references can not only
refer to Ontopia variables, but also to JSP attributes. Lookups are done
as follows:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>First the reference is looked up as an Ontopia variable.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>If this fails the reference is truncated at the first ".",
    and the result is looked up using the PageContext.findAttribute
    method. If this fails an error is reported.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>For each ".foo" after the initial reference the following is
    applied to the result of the previous operation:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>
        
<p>If the previous result is a Map the key "foo" is looked
        up.</p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>Otherwise the method "getFoo" is looked up and called.</p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>If both of the above fail the result is null, otherwise
        the next ".foo" is applied, or the value of the last returned
        if there are no more.</p>
      
</li>
</ul>
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The <tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> tag can also be used to set JSP
attributes; see the tag library reference documentation of the
<tt class="symbol">scope</tt> attribute for more information.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N103B3">4.3. Accessing Ontopia variables from the JSP EL</a>
</h3>



<p>
When the Navigator Framework is used together with other tag
libraries, especially the JSTL tag libraries, there is very often a
need to access Ontopia variables from the other tag libraries. To support
this, the <tt class="symbol">tolog:context</tt> tag registers a Map attribute
named "ontopia" in the request scope. This Map can be used to access all
Ontopia variables in effect at the time of access. This means that using
the JSP Expression Language you can access Ontopia variables using an
expression like <tt class="symbol">${ontopia.foo}</tt>.
</p>


<p>
One example of this might be the following:
</p>


<pre>
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="cms:is-about(%article.topic% : cms:work, $SUBJ : cms:subject)?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="topic.jsp?id=&lt;c:out value="${ontopia.SUBJ.objectId}"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="SUBJ"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Here the <tt class="symbol">ontopia</tt> refers to the variable map,
<tt class="symbol">SUBJ</tt> to the variable inside it containing a topic,
and <tt class="symbol">objectId</tt> to the <tt class="methodname">getObjectId</tt>
method on the topic in the variable.
</p>
