<h2>
<a name="N10023">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>
Ontopia has built-in support for storing user information in the topic
map being used by the web application. Applications that do not use
authentication and applications which want to use directory
information stored elsewhere have no need for this functionality, but
for those who really do want to maintain user information in the topic
map Ontopia provides some useful functionality.
</p>


<p>
Ontopia has a topic map vocabulary for representing users, their user
names, their passwords, user groups, privileges, and the relationships
between these. This vocabulary is used by a JAAS (Java Authentication
and Authorization Service) module that can be used to authenticate
users against the information in the topic map. There is also a
ready-made Web Editor Framework application for maintaining user
information represented using this vocabulary.
</p>




<h2>
<a name="N10031">2. The user vocabulary</a>
</h2>



<p>
The model used by the user vocabulary is very simple. There are
<em>users</em> , representing user accounts. There are
<em>roles</em>, which are basically user groups. And,
finally, there are <em>privileges</em>, which represent
specific rights within the system. Below is a simple example of a
topic map in this vocabulary in LTM format.
</p>


<pre>
#PREFIX um @"http://psi.ontopia.net/userman/#"

[lmg : um:user = "Lars Marius Garshol"]
{lmg, um:username, [[larsga]]}
{lmg, um:password, [[hemmelig]]}
um:plays-role(lmg : um:user, admin : um:role)

[admin : um:role = "Administrator"]
um:has-privilege(admin : um:receiver, edit-users     : um:privilege)
um:has-privilege(admin : um:receiver, edit-ontology  : um:privilege)
um:has-privilege(admin : um:receiver, edit-instances : um:privilege)
</pre>


<p>
The fragment above creates one user, with user name, display name, and
password. It also says that this user is an admin user, and that admin
users can edit users, edit the ontology, and edit instances. (The
meaning of each privilege is defined by the application using the
vocabulary; no privileges are part of the vocabulary itself.)
</p>


<p>
For more information, see the <a href="http://psi.ontopia.net/userman/">userman</a> PSI set.
</p>




<h2>
<a name="N10052">3. The JAAS module</a>
</h2>



<p>
JAAS is a standard Java API for authentication, which is implemented
by modules providing authentication services. JAAS modules can then be
plugged into systems that need authentication, like a web application.
Ontopia provides a JAAS implementation that allows users to
authenticate themselves against user names and passwords stored in a
topic map using the above vocabulary. The most common usage for the
JAAS module is to use it to provide authentication support in a
servlet web application.
</p>



<p>
To use module in a web application the following needs to be done:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>Configure a shared repository in the web server. (See the
    Navigator Framework Configuration Guide for directions on
    this.)</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>Configure the JAAS module as a service inside the web
    server, and make it use the shared repository.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>Configure the web application to use the JAAS module to
    control access to the application, or parts of it.</p>
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The first and second steps are dependent on the application server
being used, and so we will only document how to do it for Tomcat 5.0
in this guide. See the documentation for your application server to
learn how it is done there. Note that Tomcat versions earlier than 5.x
do not support JAAS.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10075">3.1. Setting up the JAAS module</a>
</h3>



<p>
The TMLoginModule is a JAAS module that is configured through the
<tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/jaas.config</tt> file. Normally it
only takes a single option, <tt class="symbol">topicmap</tt>, which specifies
the id of the topic map in which the user information can be found.
</p>


<pre>
/** Login Configuration for the JAAS Sample Application **/

TM {
   net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav2.realm.TMLoginModule required 
     topicmap=mytopicmap.ltm;
}; 
</pre>


<p>The JAAS module also accepts the <tt class="symbol">repository</tt> and
<tt class="symbol">jndiname</tt> options. If none of them are specified the
default repository will be used. Use the <tt class="symbol">repository</tt>
option if you need to refer to a specific repository by id. Use the
<tt class="symbol">jndiname</tt> option if you need to refer to the
repository stored in JNDI under the given name.</p>


<p>
In order for the application server to find the
<tt>jaas.config</tt> configuration file one must make the
<tt class="symbol">java.security.auth.login.config</tt> system property refer
to the <tt>jaas.config</tt>. Refer to your application
server's documentation on how to set system properties. One way of
doing this with Tomcat is to set the value of the
<tt class="symbol">JAVA_OPTS</tt> environment variable to:
</p>


<pre>
-Djava.security.auth.login.config=${ONTOPIA_HOME}/apache-tomcat/conf/jaas.config
</pre>


<p>
Having done this, the following snippet needs to be added to
<tt>apache-tomcat/conf/server.xml</tt> to set up a Tomcat
realm that uses the JAAS module.
</p>


<pre>
&lt;Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm" appName="TM"
   userClassNames="net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav2.realm.UserPrincipal"       
   roleClassNames="net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav2.realm.RolePrincipal"/&gt;
</pre>


<h4>
<a name="N100B0">3.1.1. Encrypted passwords</a>
</h4>



<p>
It's possible to store encrypted passwords (instead of plaintext
passwords) in the topic map for higher security. This protects the
passwords against accidental exposure of topic map data, as well as
other attacks. This is configured with the <tt class="symbol">hashmethod</tt>
parameter to the JAAS module (set in <tt>jaas.config</tt>).
The supported values for this parameter are listed below.
</p>


<table width="" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1" class="dbTable">
<tr class="dbTableHeaderRow"></tr>
<tr class="dbTableRow">
<td class="dbTableEntry">plaintext</td><td class="dbTableEntry">No encryption. (This is the default.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="dbTableRow">
<td class="dbTableEntry">base64</td><td class="dbTableEntry">Base64-encodes the passwords. This offers only very mild
  security.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="dbTableRow">
<td class="dbTableEntry">md5</td><td class="dbTableEntry">Produces an MD5 digest of the password, then base64-encodes
  it. Offers strong security, but means that it is impossible to
  reproduce the password from what's stored in the topic map.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd>
  
<p>Note that the user management application only supports
  plaintext passwords.</p>

</dd>
</dl>





<h3>
<a name="N100EB">3.2. Implementing authorization</a>
</h3>



<p>The TMLoginModule exposes user-group membership and privileges
as role principals. The default names for these topics will be used as
the role principal names. All authenticated users will also get the
implicit <tt class="symbol">user</tt> role principal. Applications can check
privileges and user-group membership through the
<tt class="symbol">HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String roleName)</tt>
method. The user name can be found through the
<tt class="symbol">HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser()</tt> method.</p>



<h3>
<a name="N100FD">3.3. Configuring web.xml</a>
</h3>



<p>
At this point, the next step is to configure the
<tt>web.xml</tt> of the web application to add the
necessary constraints. This is common to all application servers, and
useful information on this can be found in
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/security/tutorial/security-basic/index.xtp">Caucho's 
security tutorial</a>, as well as their
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/config/webapp.xtp#Servlet-2.4">guide 
to the web.xml elements</a>.
</p>


<p>
Below is an example snippet from a <tt>web.xml</tt> file
that sets up a very simple example of authentication. It restricts
access to everything in the <tt>/app</tt> directory in the
application, and requires the users to have the <tt class="symbol">user</tt>
role. (The JAAS module gives <em>every</em> user the
<tt class="symbol">user</tt> role, and one role per user group. The name of
the user group is the name of the role.)
</p>


<pre>
  &lt;security-constraint&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
      &lt;web-resource-name&gt;The application&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/app/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
       &lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
  &lt;/security-constraint&gt;

  &lt;login-config&gt;
    &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;
    &lt;realm-name&gt;TM&lt;/realm-name&gt;
    
    &lt;form-login-config&gt;
        &lt;form-login-page&gt;/app/login.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;
        &lt;form-error-page&gt;/app/error.jsp&lt;/form-error-page&gt;
    &lt;/form-login-config&gt;
  &lt;/login-config&gt;

  &lt;security-role&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      a user of the system
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;
  &lt;/security-role&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Note that it may not be practical to use this mechanism to implement
access control for the various kinds of users. Instead, it may be
easier to allow <em>all</em> users into the restricted
area, and then to implement the checking for whether the user has a
particular privilege in application logic.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1012E">3.4. Finding the user topic</a>
</h3>



<p>
Some applications store the user information inside the topic map used
by the application, in order to be able to attach further information
to each user topic. In these cases, it's necessary to be able to get
hold of the user topic inside the web application. This can be done by
calling the <tt class="classname">HttpServletRequest</tt> object's
<tt class="methodname">getRemoteUser</tt> method, which returns the
current user's user name.
</p>


<p>
This can then be used as follows in a web application to get the
current user topic:
</p>


<pre>&lt;tolog:set var="username"
  &gt;&lt;%= request.getRemoteUser() %&gt;&lt;/tolog:set&gt;

&lt;tolog:set var="user" query='
  using uman for i"http://psi.ontopia.net/userman/"
    uman:username($user, %username%)?
'/&gt;
</pre>


<p>
If you don't want to use Java code in the JSP file you can use the
<tt class="symbol">out</tt> tag from the core JSTL tag library instead to get
the user name.
</p>





<h2>
<a name="N1014C">4. The administration interface</a>
</h2>



<p>
Ontopia comes with an application that can be used to administrate
topic maps containing users, roles, and privileges represented with
the userman vocabulary. The application can be found in the
<tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/accessctl</tt>
directory and is written using the Web Editor Framework.
</p>


<p>
To access the application, start the Tomcat server and go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/accessctl/?tm=userman.ltm">http://localhost:8080/accessctl/?tm=userman.ltm</a>. This
will open the example topic map <tt>userman.ltm</tt> in
the application, which is useful for trying it out. (Note that to
access the application you need a user name and password; you can find
this in the userman.ltm topic map by looking at it in the Omnigator.)
