</li>
</ul>
</p> 
      
<p>Reading this document assumes some basic knowledge about topic
        maps. If you are not familiar with topic maps, try reading one of the simple
        introductions, such as 
        <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html">The
          TAO of Topic Maps</a>, available from the Ontopia web site. If you are
        technically minded, you might also want to look at the 
        <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/">XTM
          Specification</a> or the latest drafts of the new version of ISO 13250,
        especially the 
        <a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/">Data
          Model</a>.</p> 
      
<p> We welcome any suggestions you might have on ways of
      improving this User Guide. Please send them to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ontopia">the mailing

<h2>
<a name="N10055">1. Introduction</a>
</h2> 
     
    
<p>The Topic Maps model describes the knowledge structures inherent in
      an underlying body of information. This model, which reflects the associative
      mode typical of the way humans think, can then be intuitively perused in
      different ways. </p> 
    
<p>One possibility is a text-based interface. The Ontopia Omnigator (the
      name is a contraction of "omnivorous navigator") uses a form-based navigation
      paradigm that is commonly known and used by most of us every day when using the
      web. </p> 
    
<p>However, often a picture or graphic can be easier to grasp than a
      wordy description. The Ontopia Vizigator ("vi[z]ual navigator") uses a
      graphical interface to provide an additional method of topic map navigation.
      Although Vizigator can be used on its own, it is also well-suited to complement
      a text-based interface.</p> 
    
<h3>
<a name="N10063">1.1. Components</a>
</h3> 
       
      
<p> Vizigator consists of three components which are related/dependent
        on each other. 
        <ul>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>VizDesktop</strong> -
              designer's configuration tool</p> 
            
<p> VizDesktop can be used without any other Ontopia browsing
              environment. However, it is primarily a configuration tool for application
              designers to determine whether and/or how various topic types and associations
              will be graphically displayed. This is the entry point to the entire Ontopia
              Vizigator. To get started, see <a href="#vd01">section
        2</a>
</p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>VizLet</strong> - reusable
              applet component</p> 

            
<p> All of the visualization capability of VizDesktop, but
              without the configuration toolkit, VizLet can be used within other web
              applications. To bring topic map visualization to any web site, see
              <a href="#vl01">section
        3</a>
</p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>VizPlugin</strong> -
              Omnigator plug-in</p> 

            
<p> Based on VizLet, VizPlugin can be used to visualize any
              topic currently under view in Omnigator. To find out more about navigating
              visually in Omnigator, see <a href="#vp01">section
        4</a>
</p> 
          
</li>
</ul>
</p> 

        
<p>Vizigator uses TouchGraph, an open source toolkit for
        graph visualization, which is maintained as a Sourceforge
        project. For further information, please see the <a href="http://touchgraph.sourceforge.net/discuss.html">Sourceforge
        project homepage</a> and the <a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/index.html">TouchGraph
        homepage</a> with other example applications.</p>
     
    
<h3>
<a name="scope">1.2. Scope of Use</a>
</h3> 
       
      
<p>Vizigator is designed for graphically browsing and navigating topic
        maps. It supports all aspects of ISO 13250 with the exception of merging and
        some aspects of scope. It accepts topic maps in a variety of serialization
        syntaxes. </p> 
      
<p>Vizigator is used to visualize a topic map, not an ontology. That
        is, Vizigator is designed to help users understand, navigate, and browse a
        populated topic map via a graphical interface.</p> 
      
<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd> 
        
<p>It is possible to visualize an ontology using Vizigator; however,
          it requires modifications to the topic map. One way to accomplish this is to
          create a topic type, such as 'ontology_topic' and make all typing topics an
          instance of that type.</p> 
      
</dd>
</dl> 
      
<p>Creating and editing topic maps via Vizigator is not supported at
        this time.</p> 
     
    
<h3>
<a name="locsupport">1.3. Localization Support</a>
</h3> 
       
      
<p> Vizigator has internationalization support for translating the
        user interface into any language. The following table lists the currently
        supported languages and the codes that should be used to designate their use
        (see <a href="#startvizdesktop">section
        2.1</a> and <a href="#usevizlet">section
        3.2</a>).
        Additional languages will be added over time. </p>

<h2>
<a name="vd01">2. VizDesktop - Getting started with Vizigator</a>
</h2> 
     

      
<p>VizDesktop provides: 
        <ul>
<li> 
            
<p>a simple graphical topic map browser;</p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>tools to configure views for Omnigator (VizPlugin) or your

</li>
</ul>
</p> 
      
<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd> 
        
<p>The VizDesktop application is developed using the GUI
        toolkit (Java Foundation Classes(JFC)/Swing) provided with
        Java platform 2 standard edition (J2SE). The general look and
        feel of the user interface is according to the Java Swing

<h3>
<a name="startvizdesktop">2.1. Starting VizDesktop</a>
</h3> 
       
      
<p>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> VizDesktop
      is a Java application and requires the Java Developer Kit (JDK),
      Standard Edition Version 1.3 (or higher).</p>
      
      
<p>Starting VizDesktop: 
        <ol>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>On Windows</strong> execute the
              <tt>vizdesktop.bat</tt> file in
              <tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}\bin</tt>.</p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>On UNIX/Linux</strong> execute the
              <tt>vizdesktop.sh</tt> file in
              <tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/bin</tt>.</p> 
          
</li>
</ol>
</p> 
      
<p> To set the language used in the VizDesktop interface, you can edit
        the command line in the 
        <tt>.bat</tt> or 
        <tt>.sh</tt> file with the parameter 
        <tt>--lang=&lt;lang&gt;</tt> where 
        <tt>&lt;lang&gt;</tt> is a two-character designation of the
        language to be used. (See <a href="#locsupport">section
        1.3</a> for the list of
        supported languages.) Alternatively, you can add the parameter when invoking
        the batch files: 
        <ol>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>On Windows</strong>: 
              <tt>vizdesktop --lang=&lt;lang&gt;</tt>

<h4>
<a name="N101A9">2.2.1. Primary graphical conventions</a>
</h4> 
         
        
<p>Conventions for visualization of topic map constructs are as
          follows: 
          <ul>
<li> 
              
<p>
<strong>Topics</strong> appear as nodes
                with a topic name. Other names by which the topic is known are available via the
                <dfn>Properties box</dfn> accessible via the context menu (right
                click on the topic). </p> 
              
<p> Alternatively, all topic names in a given scope can be
                displayed by choosing a scoping topic from the 
                <tt>Name Scoping</tt> menu item. If a topic does not
                have a name within a chosen scope, the <dfn>unconstrained
                scope</dfn> topic name is used.</p> 
              
<p>The algorithm for determining which topic name to display in
                the unconstrained scope is as follows: 
                <ul>
<li> 
                    
<p>use an unscoped name (randomly selected if more than
                      1), </p> 
                  
</li>
<li> 
                    
<p>else, use a scoped name (randomly selected if more
                      than 1).</p>

<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd> 
                  
<p>Very long topic names will be shortened
                    algorithmically to aid visualization. Shortened names will end in '...' and
                    holding the mouse over the node will cause the name to expand.</p>

</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<strong>Topic Types</strong> are
                distinguishable based on the shape, color, and other style characteristics
                applied to the node. The name of the type is available on the Properties
                box.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<strong>Associations</strong> between
                topics are shown as edges (lines). Association types are distinguishable based
                on the shape and color of the edge. Association types and role names are
                visible during mouse-over; role names may be optionally suppressed.</p> 
              
<p> By default, all associations in all scopes are displayed.
                It is possible to filter associations by scope using the <em>Association
                Scoping</em> menu item (see <a href="#assoc_scope">section
        2.4.7</a>).</p>

          and saved in a configuration for the specific topic map. </p> 
      
      
<h4>
<a name="N10210">2.2.2. Viewing principles</a>
</h4>
         
        
<p>For the purposes of this section, we will ignore the fact that
          the graph in Vizigator represents a topic map, and instead focus on the graph
          and what happens to it. This means that in general, a node is considered to be
          just a node, regardless of whether it represents a topic or an association.
          </p>
        
<p> The graph available through Vizigator is best seen as divided
          into three sets: </p> 
        
<dl>
<dt>The complete graph</dt>
<dd> 
               
              
<p>This is the entire, unfiltered graph where every topic and
                association in the topic map have corresponding nodes and edges.</p> 
            
</dd>
<dt>The filtered graph</dt>
<dd> 
               
              
<p>This is the graph as filtered by the type and scope filter
                settings.</p> 
            
</dd>
<dt>The visible graph</dt>
<dd> 
               
              
<p>This is the graph that is actually shown in the Vizigator
                screen (including parts that may be scrolled off outside the rectangle
                currently being shown).</p> 
            
</dd>
</dl> 
        
<p> The visible graph is always a subset of the filtered graph
          (though not necessarily a true subset), and the filtered graph is always a
          subset of the complete graph (though again not necessarily a true subset). The
          filter settings determine what's in the filtered graph, but determining what is
          in the visible graph is more complex. There are two views or modes of operation

                modify the visible graph by both adding and removing nodes and edges.</p> 
            
<ul>
<li> 
                
<p>
<strong>Focus Node</strong>. The node
                  from which the locality is computed in Topic View. It is designated by double
                  clicking on a topic or by defining or using a <dfn>Start
                  Topic</dfn>. If in Map View at the time a Focus Node is chosen, the
                  display changes to Topic View; if in Topic View, the display refocuses on the
                  new Focus Node.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<li> 
                
<p>
<strong>Start Topic</strong>. The node
                  that is focused when the topic map is opened (if there is a pre-defined
                  configuration that includes a Start Topic). Topic View is initiated when a
                  topic is designated as the Start Topic (via the topic's context menu) or when
                  choosing to focus on a previously defined Start Topic via the 
                  <tt>View\Focus Start Topic</tt> menu item. Only one
                  topic can be designated as the Start Topic at any one time. Returning to Map
                  View or designating a new Focus Node does not affect the Start Topic
                  designation.</p>

<p> When initially loading a topic map, dialog boxes allow
        the user to choose a Focus Node, to proceed with modelling a
        Map View, or to cancel the loading. From a Topic View, Map
        View can be can be restored via the <tt>View\Map

<a name="sl01">2.2.3. Screen Layout</a>

<p>The VizDesktop window includes a main menu bar, three scroll
          bars, a number control, and a search box: 
          <ul>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>VizDesktop Window</em>. The file names of
                the open topic map and loaded configuration (if any) are displayed at the top
                of the VizDesktop Window.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Menu bar</em>. See <a href="#menubar">section

</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Scroll bars</em>. The vertical scroll bar
                at the right of the window and the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the
                window are used to position the graph in the viewing area, much like any other
                graphical viewer. The graph also can be repositioned by dragging the nodes
                using the mouse or by dragging the background. </p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Zoom bar</em>. The scroll bar at the top of
                the screen, the <dfn>zoom bar</dfn>, is used to zoom
                in/out of the topic map. When the thumbwheel is all the way to the left, all of
                the nodes are very close together and the lines between them will not even be
                visible. As the thumbwheel is moved to the right, the nodes spread out and the
                relationships (lines) become visible. The optimum location of the zoom bar's
                thumbwheel will vary based on the size of the topic map or the portion of the
                topic map chosen for viewing.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Locality factor</em>. To the left of the
                zoom bar is a box with an increment/decrement number control. This
                <dfn>locality factor</dfn> designates the maximum number of hops to
                be displayed from the Focus Node when in a Topic View. Locality factor has no
                effect on Map View. </p> 
              
<p>The locality factor number can be changed by clicking on
                the arrows or by typing in a number. The maximum value accessible using the
                arrows is the maximum distance between topics within the current topic map. If
                some associations have been filtered out of the view, the number might be
                misleading because even though the locality factor is increased, the display
                won't change. </p> 
              
<p>A small red box with a number (or asterisk for numbers
                higher than 9), the <dfn>further-associations box</dfn>, appears in
                the upper right hand corner of a topic shape when a topic has additional
                associations that are beyond the range of the locality factor. A single left
                click on the topic will display that set of associations. The display can be
                collapsed again by right clicking on the topic and choosing 
                <tt>collapse node</tt> from the context menu.
                Associations outside the range of the locality, or those not made to other
                topics within the locality will be removed. Those that are within the locality
                or are linked to other topics within the locality will remain.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Search box</em>. The search box is located
                just above the zoom bar at the top of the window. See <a href="#search01">section
        2.3</a> for details on the use of the search box.</p>

<p>What to expect when loading a topic map will differ depending on
          whether or not a configuration has been saved for the topic map.</p> 
        
<ul>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>When loading a topic map for the first
              time</strong>, it will open in Map View or Topic View based on the user's
              choices in the 
              <tt>Select initial topic</tt> and follow-on dialog
              boxes. It does not load any default configuration which could reduce the
              complexity of a large topic map. </p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>
<strong>When loading a topic map for which
              there is a configuration</strong>, the visualization will conform to the
              parameters of the configuration (see <a href="#configcomponents">section
        2.4.1</a>). If a
              Start Topic was designated, it will open in Topic View; otherwise, it will open
              in Map View.</p> 
          
</li>
</ul> 
        
<p> Hints for achieving a sensible display of a very large topic
          map: 
          <ul>
<li> 
              
<p>Setting the zoom bar furthest to the left will force the
                greatest number of topics into the viewing space; in most cases it will include
                all topics. Use the zoom bar to zoom into the topic map and choose a current
                topic by double clicking a topic. The view will change into the Topic View with
                the focus around the chosen topic and in conformance with the current locality
                factor. </p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>Although a locality factor of 2 or 3 for a topic view may
                seem like quite a low number, in a large topic map there can still be an
                overwhelming number of topics visible. It is often easier to start with a
                locality factor of 1 and increase that as needed.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>Removing the 'Instance of" association is often useful when
                the locality is set to 2 or more in a large topic map. For example, if the
                topic under consideration is 
                <tt>Florence</tt>, one association level away might
                be the topic 
                <tt>city</tt>, and two associations away would be all
                other instances of 
                <tt>city</tt>. Removing the 
                <tt>Instance of</tt> association, would remove the
                presence of all of the other topics that are instances of type 
                <tt>city</tt>. </p>

<h4>
<a name="filtering">2.4.2. Filtering Topics and Associations</a>
</h4> 
 


<p>The <tt>Filtering Topics</tt> and <tt>Filtering
Associations</tt> menus provide checklists for including or
excluding topic and association types to be displayed.  Unchecking the
box of a particular topic type will remove all of the topics of that
type from the visualization, as well as any associations by which they
are linked to other topics. Conversely, unchecking the box of a
particular association type will remove all of the associations of
that type and any topics that are only in the visualization because of
that association.</p>


<p>For example, assume that a topic map has both
<tt>born-in</tt> and <tt>died-in</tt>
associations, each expressing relationships between a
<tt>person</tt> and either a <tt>city</tt> or a
<tt>country</tt>. </p>


<p>Unchecking the topic type <tt>city</tt> will remove
not only all of the topics of type <tt>city</tt>, but also
all <tt>born-in</tt> and <tt>died-in</tt>
associations in which a <tt>city</tt> plays the
<tt>place</tt> role, but not in which a
<tt>country</tt> plays that role. Unchecking the
<tt>born-in</tt> association will remove all such
associations and topics of type either <tt>city</tt> or
<tt>country</tt> that play the <tt>place</tt> role
in each instance of that association (and which do not play any other
roles in that view).</p>


<p>Note that if the checkbox is shown in gray this means that the
topic or association type has no setting, and that the setting used is
that of the default topic or association type. Checkboxes shown in
green or red are set specifically for the given topic/association
type. The menu will contain an item for "Default type" which can be
used to change the default setting.</p>
 


<h4>
<a name="stylingtopics">2.4.3. Styling Topics and Associations</a>
</h4> 
 


<p> The <tt>Styling</tt> menu consists of two items to
change the randomly pre-assigned shapes, colors, and fonts used to
designate topic and association types.</p>


<p>The <tt>Styling\Styling Associations</tt> and
<tt>Styling\Styling Topics</tt> menu items each bring up
similar dialog boxes for choosing the Shape (geometric shape, weight)
, color, and font to be used for topics or associations of a
particular type. The <tt>Icon</tt> portion of the
<tt>Shape</tt> tab can be used to stipulate an icon to
appear to the left of each topic of that type. Clicking
<tt>Clear</tt> will clear the field and remove the icons for
the designated type.</p>


<p>Note that a type can either have a specified setting, or it can
use the setting for the default type. The default type appears in the
list and its settings can be changed just like those of real
types. There is also a button for each type that can be used to remove
all settings so that it reverts to getting its settings from the
default type.</p>
 


<h4>
<a name="genoptions">2.4.4. Determining General Options</a>
</h4> 
 
        
<p>The 
          <tt>Options\General</tt> menu item brings up the
          multi-tabbed 
          <tt>General Options</tt> dialog box, which is used to set
          more general parameters: 
          <ul>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Interaction</em> - mouse button default
                behavior is described in <a href="#nav">section
        2.2.6</a>; this tab is used to override
                that behavior and to designate the amount of information to be displayed when
                hovering over an association.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Background Color</em> - for choosing the
                background color to be used in the visualization.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<em>Topic Type Exclusion</em> - for choosing
                the typing topics that should not be visible. Continuing the example from
                <a href="#filtering">section
        2.4.2</a>, unchecking the 
                <tt>city</tt> topic type under the 
                <tt>Filtering Topics</tt> menu will remove all
                instances of 
                <tt>city</tt>, but will not remove the 
                <tt>city</tt> topic itself. This dialog box can be
                used to remove the typing topic 
                <tt>city</tt>, regardless of whether instances of the
                topic type are also removed.</p> 
            
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a name="sect-type-precedence">2.4.5. Topic Type Precedence</a>
</h4>



<p>
The <tt>Options\Topic Type Precedence</tt> menu item brings
up a simple dialog box that can be used to specify the precedence
order of topic types. This is used to determine how to render topics
which have more than one type. Topics which have more than one type
will then be rendered according to the configuration for the topic
which is comes first in the precedence order.
</p>

 
      
<h4>
<a name="name_scope">2.4.6. Name Scoping</a>
</h4> 
         
        
<p>The 
          <tt>Name Scoping</tt> menu offers a choice of scoping
          topics available in the topic map (if any) to be applied to the Topic Names of
          all topics. Choosing a scoping topic makes that scope active. The active scope
          will be saved with a configuration.</p> 
       
      
<h4>
<a name="assoc_scope">2.4.7. Association Scoping</a>
</h4> 
         
        
<p>The 
          <tt>Association Scoping</tt> menu offers a choice of
          scoping topics available in the topic map (if any) to be applied to the
          Association Types of all topics. </p> 
        
<p>The menu is divided into two sections. The top section has three
          options: 
          <ul>
<li> 
              
<p>
<tt>Show All</tt>: In this mode, the scope filter
                is off, and none of the settings in the lower part of the menu have any effect.
                All associations are shown, regardless of their scope.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<tt>Loose Filter</tt>: In this mode, the scope
                filter is on, and all associations whose scopes contain one of the chosen
                scoping topics in the lower section will be shown.</p> 
            
</li>
<li> 
              
<p>
<tt>Strict Filter</tt>: In this mode, the scope
                filter is on, and all associations which are in the unconstrained scope or
                whose scope contain all of the chosen scoping topics will be shown.</p> 
            
</li>
</ul>
</p> 
        
<p>The lower section contains one item for every topic that occurs
          in the scope of an association in the topic map, sorted alphabetically. If the
          scoping topics are instances of more than one type (say, if some are instances
          of "language" and others of "country"), the menu will have an additional
          level.</p> 
        
<p>Choosing a scoping topic makes that scope active. The active
          scope will be saved with a configuration.</p> 
       
      
<h4>
<a name="N1069B">2.4.8. Saving and using the configuration</a>
</h4> 
         
        
<p>The current state of the configuration settings can be saved
          using the 'File menu'. </p> 
        
<p>When a topic map (e.g., foo.xtm) is loaded into VizDesktop, if a
          configuration file (e.g., foo.xtm.viz) exists in the same directory, it will be
          automatically loaded at the same time.</p> 
        
<p>Otherwise, a topic map is loaded without a defined configuration,
          that is, all topics and associations are visible and VizDesktop uses default
          shapes and fonts, and randomly assigned colors for topic and association type
          displays.</p> 
        
<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd> 
          
<p>In order for configuration files to properly do their job, they
            have to be able to reference topics in a topic map. There are a number of ways
            in which this can be done, some more robust than others.</p> 
          
<p>The most robust method is through a subject identifier, which
            Vizigator will use if available. Where no subject identifier has been specified
            by the author of the topic map, the fallback solution is for Vizigator to use
            the item identifier, which involves pointing back into the source topic map file
            itself. What this means is that if the file is moved to another location, the
            references may break. The moral of this story is always use subject
            identifiers, especially for typing topics. </p>

    &lt;param name="idvalue"  value="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/country.xtm#cn"/&gt;
  &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre> 
      
<p>The applet parameters are as follows:</p> 

      
<dl>
<dt>tmrap</dt>
<dd>This is the URL on the server where the TMRAP servlet can be
              found. (More about how to set these up below.) The URL is resolved relative to
              the code base of the applet.</dd>
<dt>config</dt>
<dd>This is the URL on the server where the configuration topic
              map in XTM syntax can be found. VizLet will load it directly from this URL. The
              URL is resolved relative to the code base of the applet. If this parameter is
              omitted, VizLet will work without a configuration.</dd>
<dt>tmid</dt>
<dd>This is the ID of the topic map in the topic map
              registry.</dd>
<dt>idvalue</dt>
<dd>This is the identifying value used to look up the Focus Node
              to be loaded in VizLet. This is always a URI.</dd>
<dt>idtype</dt>
<dd>This tells VizLet what kind of identifier is contained in the
              <tt class="symbol">idvalue</tt> parameter. The alternatives are
              <tt class="literal">"source"</tt> (meaning item identifier),
              <tt class="literal">"indicator"</tt> (meaning subject identifier), and
              <tt class="literal">"subject"</tt> (meaning subject locator).</dd>
<dt>gototarget</dt>
<dd>The name of the HTML frame in which Vizlet should open topic
              pages when the user selects the "Go to Topic Page" menu item in Vizlet.
              Defaults to the current frame if not set.</dd>
<dt>proptarget</dt>
<dd>The name of the HTML frame in which Vizlet should open URLs
              when the user selects a URL in the Properties box. Defaults to
              <tt class="literal">_blank</tt> (meaning new frame every time) if not set.</dd>
<dt>scopevalue</dt>
<dd>The identifying value used to look up the topic used for name
              scoping, identified by URI. A value set here will override a value saved in the
              Vizigator configuration.</dd>
<dt>scopetype</dt>
<dd>This tells VizLet what kind of identifier is contained in the
              <tt class="symbol">scopevalue</tt> parameter. The alternatives are the same as for
              <tt class="symbol">idtype</tt>.</dd>
<dt>controlsVisible</dt>
<dd>A boolean value of 'true' or 'false' that specifies whether
              the control panel should be visible or not. The default is 'true'.</dd>
<dt>lang</dt>
<dd>Specifies the language that is to be used in the user
              interface. The default is 'en' (English). See <a href="#scope">section
        1.2</a> for the
              currently supported languages.</dd>
<dt>menufile</dt>
<dd>Specifies the location of a file which describes which menu
      items in popup menus are to be enabled or disabled. The value is a
      URI relative to the URI the applet was loaded from. For more
      detail, see <a href="#sect-menufile">section
        3.2.1</a>.</dd>
<dt>locality</dt>
<dd>The locality setting VizLet starts with on loading. The
      default is 1.</dd>
<dt>max-locality</dt>
<dd>The largest locality value which VizLet will accept. The
      default is 5.</dd>
<dt>wallpaper_image</dt>
<dd>A URL pointing to an image to be used as a wallpaper
      background in the Vizlet. If no URL is provided, no background
      will be shown.</dd>
</dl> 


<p>In order for this to work, a number of things need to be set up
on the server side, and we will walk through them one by one. One
example of how this can be done can be found in VizPlugin for
Omnigator; looking at its source code may be instructive.</p>


<p>The first step is to make the
<tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/extras/ontopia-vizlet.jar</tt> file available on the server
side. Put it anywhere you want, then make the <tt class="symbol">applet</tt>
element refer to it. Use the Java console of your web browser to check
whether you have succeeded or not. For more information consult <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.4">the HTML
4.01 Recommendation</a>.</p>
      
<p>The next step is to set up the TMRAP (topic map remote access
        protocol) servlet used by the applet to download topic map fragments for the
        visualization. This is done by adding the following to the
        <tt>web.xml</tt> file of the web application:</p> 
      
<pre>
  &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;TMRAPServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.tmrap.RAPServlet
    &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
      &lt;param-name&gt;view_uri&lt;/param-name&gt;
      &lt;param-value&gt;http://localhost:8080/omnigator/models/topic_complete.jsp?tm=%tmid%&amp;amp;id=%topicid%&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
      &lt;param-name&gt;edit_uri&lt;/param-name&gt;
      &lt;param-value&gt;http://localhost:8080/ontopoly/enter.ted?tm=%tmid%&amp;amp;id=%topicid%&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;/servlet&gt;

  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;TMRAPServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/plugins/viz/xtm-fragment&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;TMRAPServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/plugins/viz/topic-page&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre> 
      
<p>The <tt class="symbol">url-pattern</tt> parameter must match what is given
        in the <tt class="symbol">tmrap</tt> parameter to the applet, so that the servlet is
        made available where the applet expects to find it. Also, the
        <tt class="symbol">uri</tt> parameter to the servlet must be a URI template where once
        the topic map ID and topic ID are filled in, the main page for the topic can be
        found. VizLet will go to this URI when the "Go to Topic Page" option is
        selected in VizLet.</p> 
      
<p>The final part is to place the configuration XTM file somewhere on
        the server so that VizLet can download it. This must be in the location that
        the <tt class="symbol">config</tt> parameter refers to. VizPlugin uses a JSP file to
        do this, because it needs to be able to support multiple configurations, but if
        you only have a single configuration file you can just refer to it directly and
        store it on the server as a normal file.</p> 
      
<p>If you experience unexpected results with VizLet, please do the
        following: 
        <ul>
<li> 
            
<p>empty the browser cache, restart the brower, and try again,
              to make sure you have the latest version of the VizLet;</p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>check the Java Console, as the VizLet will print its version
              number and build number there; and </p> 
          
</li>
<li> 
            
<p>check the Java Console for exceptions, which we would very
              much like to see in any bug reports.</p> 
          
</li>
</ul>
</p> 



<h4>
<a name="sect-menufile">3.2.1. The menufile parameter</a>
</h4>



<p>
As stated above, this parameter specifies the location of a file which
describes which menu items in popup menus should be visible. The menu
file is a normal text file, of which an example can be seen below:
</p>


<pre>expand.node=on
collapse.node=on
hide.node=on
hide.edge=on
sticky=on
properties=off       # users never use this, anyway
set.start.topic=on
go.to.topic.page=off # we don't have topic pages
search.bar=off
</pre>


<p>
Menu items that are not mentioned in the file will be displayed (and
if the parameter is not given all items are displayed). The list of
menu choice names is:

<h3>
<a name="sect-copy-name">3.3. The "Copy name" operation</a>
</h3>



<p>
In VizDesktop the popup menu on topic nodes contains a "Copy name"
choice, which copies the name of the node to the system clipboard.
This menu choice is by default not present in VizLet because for
security reasons applets do not have access to the clipboard.
(Otherwise, web pages would be able to spy on your clipboard, or spam
it with unwelcome content.)
</p>


<p>
To solve this, there is another version of the VizLet in the
<tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/extras/signed-vizlet.jar</tt> file, which is
cryptographically signed. This gives the VizLet access to the
clipboard, provided users accept the certificate with which it was
signed. In order to avoid bothering users with certificates the
VizPlugin (see <a href="#vp01">section
        4</a>) does not use the signed applet.
</p>


<p>
Using the signed applet is not in itself enough to enable the "Copy
name" menu item. To do this, use the <tt class="symbol">menufile</tt>
parameter to VizLet as described in <a href="#sect-menufile">section
        3.2.1</a>.
</p>


 
  
<h2>
<a name="vp01">4. VizPlugin - Vizigating in Omnigator</a>
</h2> 
     

      
<p> VizPlugin is an Omnigator plug-in that adds support for graphic
        visual navigation of topic maps. It uses VizLet (described in
        <a href="#vl01">section
        3</a>) to support visualization directly in the browser. Like
        the other plug-ins, it appears as a button (<dfn>Vizigate</dfn>) in
        the row of links at the top of Omnigator topic pages. </p> 

      
<p>All of the restrictions and differences that apply to VizLet, when
        compared to VizDesktop, also apply to VizPlugin.</p> 

    
<h3>
