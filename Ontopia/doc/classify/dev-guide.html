<h2>Abstract</h2>


<p>
This Developer's Guide is an introduction to the automatic
classification in Ontopia, and shows how to use it to classify content
into a topic map.
</p>



<h2>
<a name="N10023">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>The automatic classification module can be used to process
content to either classify it automatically, or give suggestions for
classification to a user who can then fine-tune the suggestions into
the final classification.</p>


<p>Given a file the module does the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>detect the format of the file,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>extract the textual content from the file,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>detect the language of the text,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>process the text to find out what it is about.</p>
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>The module returns a set of terms, each one of which has a score
between 0 and 1 expressing how confident the module is that the
content is about this term. The module does stemming of terms found in
the content, based on the detected language, so that different
variants of a single term, like "widget" and "widgets" are treated as
a single term. The API provides mechanisms to access all variants of a
term.</p>


<p>It's also possible to provide a topic map to the classifier, and
if so the classifier will use information in this topic map to provide
better classification results. For example, terms which occur in the
topic map will be ranked higher than terms which do not. The
information is also used to help the classifier detect compound terms
(like "Topic Maps" or "New York").</p>

<p>The module is still fairly immature, and so it's hard to predict
how well the module will perform on any given collection of content.
In general, however, the longer the text and the more focused on
particular concepts it is, the better the module will perform. It also
tends to be confused by mixed-language content, and by embedded code
and markup. These last two problems can be handled, but not through
the PUBLIC API. For help on this sort of issue, please contact the
mailing list.</p>


<p>The following formats are supported:</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>plain text,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>plain XML (using any schema),</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>HTML,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>PDF,</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>Microsoft Word format (.doc binary),</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>Microsoft Powerpoint format (.ppt binary),</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>OOXML WordProcessingML format (.docx), and</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>OOXML PresentationML format (.pptx).</p>
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>At the moment, the languages supported are Norwegian and English
only, but it is possible to plug in support for more languages. If you
are interested in doing this, please contact the mailing list.</p>



<h2>
<a name="N10092">2. Running the classifier</a>
</h2>



<p>The simplest way to run the classifier is to use
<tt class="classname">Chew</tt>, the command-line tool. This takes a
content file and, optionally, a topic map as input, and provides a
textual dump of the classification results (as shown above). The main
benefit of this is that it makes it easy to try out the
classifier and see how it works on your content.</p>


<p>To try <tt class="classname">Chew</tt> run the command
<tt>java net.ontopia.topicmaps.classify.Chew</tt>
and follow the instructions you get.</p>


<p>To really make use of the classifier you have to write your own
code to process content and update the topic map accordingly. To do
that, use the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.classify.SimpleClassifier</tt>
class. This will let you provide a reference to a file or URI, and
will return a <tt class="classname">TermDatabase</tt> with the
classification results. From this you can update the topic map as
desired, or even provide suggestions to users.</p>


<p>For more details, please consult the javadoc.</p>


<p>We are well aware that this limited API probably provides less
functionality than users may need, but are awaiting further user
feedback before we provide a more detailed API. Feedback to the
mailing list is very much welcome.</p>
