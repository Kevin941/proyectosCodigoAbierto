<h2>Abstract</h2>




<p>
This Developer's Guide is an introduction to the Ontopia Topic Maps
Engine, intended for developers who will be using the engine API to
develop Topic Maps applications. The main features of the API are
described, together with some background information to help
developers understand the intended use of the API facilities.
</p>


<p>
Additional information about the core Topic Maps API interfaces can be
found in the javadoc. In addition to the core Topic Maps API, utilities
are provided for working with and performing various operations on a
topic map, and for handling objects which implement the API
interfaces.  These utilities are not so fully documented in the
javadoc; this guide gives an overview which will help developers
understand what utilities are available and how to use them.
</p>


<p>
Familiarity with Topic Maps concepts, and the Java platform, is
assumed in this guide.
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N1002B">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>
The Ontopia Topic Maps Engine is the heart of Ontopia, on which all
the other components are based. The job of representing, storing, and
making available topic maps to the rest of the product suite is its
job, and without this crucial function none of Ontopia can do its
work.
</p>


<p>
In addition to providing a service internally within Ontopia the
engine also provides a rich API against which Topic Maps-based
applications may be built. However, despite the centrality of the
engine within the product suite, the engine should not be used for all
kinds of application development. For example, for web applications
Ontopia provides the Navigator and Web Editor Frameworks, which are
much more appropriate for this purpose.
</p>


<p>
Ontopia also includes the Query Engine, which implements the tolog
query language. For retrieving information from the topic maps the
query language is far better suited than the API. It makes the task
enormously much easier, while at the same time enabling far better
performance, since the query engine can take shortcuts not available
to applications working through the API.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10039">1.1. Architecture of the Ontopia Topic Maps Engine</a>
</h3>



<p>
The Topic Maps Engine and the Ontopia Knowledge Suite have been
designed to support many different deployment scenarios. The most
common, building an application on the engine using the RDBMS backend,
is shown in the figure below.
</p>


<p align="center">
  
  
<img align="center" src="EngineArch.gif">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 1. The engine architecture</b>
</p>


<p>
The diagram shows the overall working relationships between a Topic
Maps application, i.e. what you as a developer will build, the engine
API, the utility packages, and a storage backend. The Topic Maps
application is expected to make direct use of the engine API and the
Topic Maps utilities.
</p>


<p>
The rest of this document concentrates on the engine API and the topic
map utilities, with a brief overview of the general utilities.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10052">1.2. An overview of the engine API</a>
</h3>



<p>
The heart of the engine is the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.core</tt> package.  This package
defines the interfaces of the objects that represent the information
in a topic map, such as the topic map itself, topics, occurrences,
associations and so on. These interfaces are commonly referred to as
the <dfn>core interfaces</dfn>. There is detailed
documentation for these interfaces in the javadoc.  When reading the
javadoc, remember that the 'IF' suffix is used to indicate an
interface, throughout the Ontopia product suite; for example, the
common interface for a topic object is called TopicIF.  This core API
accommodates concepts from various versions of the topic map
standards; these are clearly indicated in the javadoc.
</p>


<p>
The engine contains several implementations of the core interfaces,
each in a separate package below the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl</tt> package. There is one
implementation of the core interfaces for each storage backend, and
there are also some implementations that do not use a storage
backend. (We will return to these later.) All these implementations
should behave identically, except for their performance
characteristics, which will necessarily be different. Please note that
all code that uses the engine should use variables and arguments
declared to use the interfaces in
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.core</tt>, since this makes the code
independent of the specific implementation used.  In particular, this
allows an application to be piloted using the in-memory
implementation, then brought into production using a database
back-end, without any changes to the application code.
</p>

      
<p>
Most items, that is, interfaces, classes and methods, in the javadoc
have an initial tag attached to them explaining the status of the
documented item. The tags currently used are:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>PUBLIC</dt>
<dd>This tag means that the item is part of the public API of the
      product that is being made available to developers for use in building
      applications on top of the product.</dd>
<dt>INTERNAL</dt>
<dd>This tag means that the item is used by the internals of the
      product, but is being made available to third-party code anyway
      because the design of the product (and of the Java language) requires
      it to be. Such items may change at any time and with no advance warning.
      </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>EXPERIMENTAL</dt>
<dd>This tag means that the item is currently being developed and
      not yet finished, in interface or in implementation. There is no
      guarantee that it will work as documented or that it will not change
      from one day to the next.</dd>
</dl>



<h3>
<a name="N10097">1.3. Overview of the engine packages</a>
</h3>



<p>
This section briefly lists the different Java packages that the
Ontopia Engine consists of. Introductions to the use of each package
follow later.
</p>


<dl>
<dt>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.core
    </dt>
<dd>This package contains the core interfaces already
      described.</dd>
<dt>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.index
    </dt>
<dd>
<p>
        This package contains common interfaces for indexes which provide
        optimized look-up of information held in a topic map, such as all
        topics of a given type, whether a topic is used as an association type
        anywhere and so on.  This package contains only interfaces implemented
        elsewhere; as with the core engine API, each specific implementation
        uses these interfaces, so that a developer need only write to the
        common, repository-independent API.
      </p>
<p>
        Ontopia is participating in the development of a standardized Topic
        Map Query Language (TMQL), which in due course will provide much the
        same functionality as these indexes do. In the meantime, however, the
        indexes are the preferred way to do such lookups.
      </p>
</dd>
<dt>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils
    </dt>
<dd>Contains various utility classes for working with
      topic maps. Together with the indexes, these provide a repertoire of
      operations like topic map traversal and filtering, support for merging
      and so on.</dd>
<dt>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml
    </dt>
<dd>
        Contains topic map-specific XML-related utilities; the classes used to
        load topic maps from XML topic map interchange documents and export
        them back to XML. There are separate classes here for the ISO 13250
        and XTM syntaxes.
      </dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.entry</dt>
<dd>Contains generic interfaces and helper classes for locating
      topic maps in file systems and persistent stores, and managing
      references to them.</dd>
</dl>



<h3>
<a name="N100EE">1.4. Support for TMAPI</a>
</h3>



<p>
Ontopia now supports <a href="http://www.tmapi.org/2.0/">TMAPI
2.0</a>, which is a de-facto standard Java API for Topic Maps
engines. The API is supported by wrapping the Ontopia core interfaces
in TMAPI interface implementations.
</p>


<p>
To use the TMAPI support, all that's needed is to put the ontopia.jar
file on your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> and the
<tt class="classname">TopicMapSystemFactory</tt> class will automatically
detect Ontopia and start using it.
</p>


<p>
If you need direct access to it, the Ontopia implementation of the
<tt class="classname">TopicMapSystemFactory</tt> is called
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.tmapi2.TopicMapSystemFactory</tt>.
</p>


<p>
The rest of this document will describe the Ontopia native interfaces.
If you would like to use the TMAPI interfaces instead, please see the 
<a href="http://www.tmapi.org/2.0/">TMAPI 2.0</a> web site for
documentation of TMAPI 2.0.
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N10115">2. Getting hold of a topic map</a>
</h2>



<p>
The <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapStoreIF</tt> interface defines
the services provided by a topic map storage manager. To make a topic
map, wherever it may be stored, the way to proceed is first to
instantiate the appropriate topic map store manager (that is, whatever
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapStoreIF</tt> implementation you are
using).  After creating the storage manager, call its
<tt class="methodname">getTopicMap</tt> method to get the topic map
object that is managed by it.
</p>


<p>
Note that there is always one topic map per topic map store object.
This is so because the topic map store object only represents the
connection between the topic map object and its storage, and not the
storage repository itself.
</p>


<p>
Below is a simple example program that creates an empty topic map in
the in-memory implementation, which is also known as the basic
implementation.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.basic.InMemoryTopicMapStore;

public class Hello {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    InMemoryTopicMapStore store = new InMemoryTopicMapStore();
    TopicMapIF tm = store.getTopicMap();
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    System.out.println("I have a topic map with " + tm.getTopics().size() +
                       " topics!");
  }

}</pre>
</code>


<p>
The source code example above shows a simple Java program that
instantiates an <tt class="classname">InMemoryTopicMapStore</tt> and gets
a topic map from it. Since this topic map store is not connected to
any permanent storage the returned topic map will be empty.
</p>


<p>
Below is a list of all the
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapStoreIF</tt> implementations in the
engine:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.basic.InMemoryTopicMapStore
    </dt>
<dd>A store that represents topic maps in-memory. This is
      the default topic map store.</dd>
<dt>net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.RDBMSTopicMapStore</dt>
<dd>This is the relational database backend, which is used to
      persist topic maps in RDBMSs, using JDBC.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>
<a name="N10159">2.1. Reading topic maps from XTM files</a>
</h3>



<p>
To read a topic map from an XTM file you use the
<tt class="classname">XTMTopicMapReader</tt> class in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml</tt> package. Usage is simple:
bind the reader to a file in the constructor, then call the
<tt class="methodname">read()</tt> method to get the topic map. The
reader will then automatically create an
<tt class="classname">InMemoryTopicMapStore</tt> for you and read the
topic map into an empty topic map object.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
import java.io.File;

import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMTopicMapReader;

public class Hello2 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      XTMTopicMapReader reader = new XTMTopicMapReader(new File(args[0]));
      TopicMapIF tm = reader.read();
      System.out.println("Hello, world!");
      System.out.println("I have a topic map with " + tm.getTopics().size() +
                               " topics!");
    }
    catch (java.io.IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error reading topic map: " + e);
    }
  }

}
</pre>
</code>


<p>
Above is a new version of the previous example program. This example
uses the <tt class="classname">XTMTopicMapReader</tt> class to load an XTM
file from disk into an object structure that can then be accessed.
The reader takes care of creating an XML parser, a topic map store and
so on. (Note that to get this example to compile you may have to put
<tt>crimson.jar</tt> on your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
explicitly.)
</p>


<p>
When loading XTM files the reader will load all topic maps referred to
using <tt class="symbol">mergeMap</tt> elements and also topic maps referred
to by the <tt class="symbol">topicRef</tt> element. (For explanations of what
<tt class="symbol">mergeMap</tt> and <tt class="symbol">topicRef</tt> elements do,
see the XTM 1.0 specification.) It will also automatically merge
topics as described by annex F of the XTM 1.0 specification.
</p>


<p>
Some flexibility in resolving references to external topics and topic
maps is provided through the
<tt class="interfacename">ExternalReferenceHandlerIF</tt> interface.
Applications can implement this interface to instruct the reader
whether to read in specific external references or not and it can also
remap references to new URIs, thus overriding the URIs given in the
topic map document.
</p>


<p> Note that the readers also cater to some more specialized
situations.  If you want to read the XTM file into a specific topic
map object you do this with the
<tt class="methodname">TopicMapImporterIF.importInto</tt> method. If you
have an XML document containing several topic maps, that is, with
several <tt class="symbol">topicMap</tt> elements, you can read in all the
topic maps at the same time with the <tt class="methodname">readAll</tt>
method.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1019F">2.2. Exporting to XTM files</a>
</h3>



<p>
Any topic map that is held in the engine can be exported using the
<tt class="classname">XTMTopicMapWriter</tt> class in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml</tt> package. When this class
has been configured with a <tt class="classname">java.io.Writer</tt> and a
character encoding the <tt class="methodname">write(TopicMapIF topicmap)</tt>
can be called to write out the topic map to the
<tt class="classname">Writer</tt>.
</p>


<p>
Note that this class very carefully ensures that the character
encoding used in the XML file that is written out is known, and also
labels the file with the encoding used. The default encoding is UTF-8,
which is a convenient default that is both backwards-compatible with
ASCII and at the same time can encode any Unicode character, but this
can be overridden by the client code. Note that if the topic map
contains characters that cannot be encoded using the chosen encoding
those characters will be lost.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N101BA">2.3. Working with other syntaxes</a>
</h3>



<p>
The <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html">LTM
syntax</a> is a compact and easy-to-edit text syntax for topic
maps designed by Ontopia. This syntax is supported by the Ontopia
Topic Map Engine, and can be used just like the other topic map
syntaxes.
</p>


<p>
The engine can export and import a number of different topic map
syntaxes (XTM, the ISO 13250 HyTM syntax, and LTM), as
well as RDF. If you want your application to be able to import files
by guessing the format from the file extension, you can use the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ImportExportUtils</tt>
to create the reader and writer instances for you. This can make your
code both simpler and more flexible at the same time.
</p>


<p>
For further details, see the javadoc for
<tt class="classname">ImportExportUtils</tt> class, as well as the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ltm</tt> and
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.rdf</tt> packages.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N101D9">2.4. An example</a>
</h3>



<p>
To illustrate the information in the last few sections we will write a
simple program that converts topic maps written in LTM syntax to
XTM. Below is the source code to this command-line tool.
</p>


<code>
<pre>

import java.io.File;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.*;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMTopicMapWriter;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ltm.LTMTopicMapReader;

public class LTM2XTMConverter {

  public static void main(String [] args) {
    if (args.length != 2) {
      usage();
      System.exit(1);
    }

    try {
      convert(args[0], args[1]);
    }
    catch (java.net.MalformedURLException e) {
      System.err.println(e);
      System.exit(2);
    }
    catch (java.io.IOException e) {
      System.err.println(e);
      System.exit(2);
    }
  }

  private static void usage() {
    System.out.println("java LTM2XTMConverter &lt;in&gt; &lt;out&gt;");
    System.out.println("");
    System.out.println("  Reads a topic map and writes it out in XTM form");
    System.out.println("  &lt;in&gt;:  file name of LTM file");
    System.out.println("  &lt;out&gt;: file to write XTM to");
    System.out.println("");
  }

  private static void convert(String ltm, String xtm)
    throws java.io.IOException, java.net.MalformedURLException {
    TopicMapIF source;

    source = new LTMTopicMapReader(new File(ltm)).read();
    new XTMTopicMapWriter(xtm).write(source);
  }
}
</pre>
</code>


<p>
The source code of the program should be simple enough to understand.
The only part that is specific to the Ontopia Topic Map Engine is the
<tt class="methodname">convert</tt> method, which reads the topic map
file into a topic map object, and then writes the object back out.
It really is no harder than this.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="N101F2">3.1. An overview of the interfaces</a>
</h3>



<p>
The main interfaces of the <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.core</tt>
package are the ones in the diagram below. The arrows go from base
interfaces to derived interfaces that extend the base interfaces.  The
gray boxes represent interfaces that are never implemented directly by
a class; they represent pieces of functionality common to several
interfaces.
</p>


<p align="center">
  
  
<img align="center" src="ci-main.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 2. The main interfaces of the core package</b>
</p>


<p>
The three most important interfaces are:
<tt class="interfacename">TopicIF</tt>, representing topics,
<tt class="interfacename">AssociationIF</tt>, representing
associations and <tt class="interfacename">OccurrenceIF</tt>,
representing occurrences.
</p>


<p>
The <tt class="interfacename">TMObjectIF</tt> interface is the base
interface for all interfaces in the core package and all data classes
implement this interface.  The <tt class="interfacename">ScopedIF</tt>
interface is used by classes that represent topic map constructs that
have scope, in this case <tt class="interfacename">AssociationIF</tt>
and <tt class="interfacename">OccurrenceIF</tt>.
</p>


<p>
There is a similar interface for typed objects:
<tt class="interfacename">TypedIF</tt> for objects which can have a
single type.
</p>


<p>
Note that <tt class="interfacename">ScopedIF</tt>,
<tt class="interfacename">TypedIF</tt> are both derived from
<tt class="interfacename">TMObjectIF</tt>.
</p>


<p align="center">
  
  
<img align="center" src="ci-scope.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 3. The scoped interfaces</b>
</p>


<p> 
The interfaces shown here are all the ones which extend
<tt class="interfacename">ScopedIF</tt>, which in turn extends
<tt class="interfacename">TMObjectIF</tt>. (Note that
<tt class="interfacename">TopicIF</tt> and
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapIF</tt> for historical reasons also
do; their extension of <tt class="interfacename">ScopedIF</tt> is
deprecated, and will disappear.)
</p>


<p align="center">
  
  
<img align="center" src="ci-rest.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 4. The rest of the interfaces</b>
</p>


<p>
Left over are only two interfaces; the
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapIF</tt> interface, which directly
extends <tt class="interfacename">TMObjectIF</tt>, and
<tt class="interfacename">AssociationRoleIF</tt>, which represents the
roles played by topics participating in associations (in XTM
terminology: topics which are members of associations). For every
topic participating in an association there is an
<tt class="interfacename">AssociationRoleIF</tt> object representing
the connection point between the topic and the association.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10267">3.2. Resources, locators and URIs</a>
</h3>

  

<p>
Central to topic maps is the concept of resources, data streams which
can contain information of any kind and in any format. Topic maps can
refer to resources in one of two ways: by using URIs or by including
them inline.
</p>


<p>
In the engine resources are catered for through the interfaces in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.core</tt> package. The central concept
in that package is that of a locator, which is a string using a
particular notation to refer to an information resource. The default
notation is <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URI</a>, but any
locator syntax can be implemented.
</p>


<p>
The main interface is the <tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt>
interface, which represents a locator. It has a notation property,
which will be <tt class="literal">"URI"</tt> for URIs, and an address
property, which will contain the locator itself.  The
<tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt> implementation representing
URIs is found in the <tt class="classname">URILocator</tt> class in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.infoset.impl.basic</tt> package.
</p>
      
<p>
The design of the locator system considers locators to be
primitive values, in the same way that Java considers Strings to be
primitive values. A locator object may therefore never change its
value; instead, a new object must be substituted if a locator property
is to be changed. Similarly, all
<tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt> implementations must
implement the <tt class="methodname">hashCode</tt>,
<tt class="methodname">equals</tt> and <tt class="methodname">toString</tt>
methods.
</p>
      
<p>
It should also be noted that all locators are canonicalized to a
canonical syntactic form on creation and also absolutized. A
<tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt> object will therefore always
hold an absolute locator in canonical form, which ensures that two
logically equivalent locator objects will always compare as equal.
This has the effect that when a topic map is loaded from file, all
locators in that topic map will be absolute locators. The
<tt class="methodname">resolveAbsolute</tt> method on
<tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt> should be used to create
absolute locators from ones that are relative to a base locator.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N102A7">3.3. Using the APIs: An example</a>
</h3>



<p>
To illustrate how to work with the core interfaces, here is an example
of a small application that establishes contact with a topic map, then
prints out all the topics in that topic map with a specific topic
type. The application runs from the command-line and takes two
arguments: the file name of the XTM document and the XML ID of the
topic type.
</p>


<code>
<pre>import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Collection;

import net.ontopia.infoset.core.LocatorIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.*;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMTopicMapReader;

public class TopicsOfType {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      printTopicsOfType(new File(args[0]), args[1]);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("ERROR reading topic map: " + e);
    }
  }

  public static void printTopicsOfType(File tmfile, String typeId)
    throws IOException {
    XTMTopicMapReader reader = new XTMTopicMapReader(tmfile);
    TopicMapIF tm = reader.read();

    TopicIF topicType = getTopicByXMLId(tm, typeId);
    if (topicType == null) {
      System.err.println("ERROR: No such topic: " + typeId);
      return;
    }

    Iterator it = tm.getTopics().iterator();
    while (it.hasNext()) {
      TopicIF topic = (TopicIF) it.next();
      Collection types = topic.getTypes();
      if (types.contains(topicType))
        System.out.println(topic);
    }
  }

  private static TopicIF getTopicByXMLId(TopicMapIF tm, String id) {
    TopicMapStoreIF store = tm.getStore();
    LocatorIF loc = store.getBaseAddress().resolveAbsolute("#" + id);
    return (TopicIF) tm.getObjectByItemIdentifier(loc);
  }

}</pre>
</code>


<p>
This simple application starts by creating an
<tt class="classname">XTMTopicMapReader</tt>, which it binds to the file
it would like to read, and then retrieves the topic map. Then, it
looks up the type topic by its given ID, checks whether a topic was
actually found and then iterates over all the topics in the topic map,
printing those that have the required type.
</p>


<p>
Note that it is not possible to look a topic up by its XML ID
directly, because since the topics in a single topic map may come from
several different XML documents there is no guarantee that a topic
will have a unique ID. Instead, we associate the URIs of the elements
that gave rise to the topics with the topics in their itemIdentifiers
properties.
</p>


<p>
The <tt class="methodname">getTopicByXMLId</tt> method exploits this by
creating a URL from the base address of the topic map and the ID given
on the command-line. This means that if the topic appeared in the XML
document named on the command-line only its ID need to be given, but
if it appeared outside that document the entire URI of the topic must
be given. This simple version of the application does not handle this
case.
</p>


<p>
Notice how this example only uses the core API, so that it can easily
be used with topic maps stored in databases or any other storage
implementation. Note also how awkward it is, given the comparative
simplicity of what it is trying to achieve. For this task, as for most
tasks, it would be far better to use tolog.
</p>
      

<p>
When run on a topic map the example will produce output like that
shown below.  In this case it has been told to print all the topics of
type "script" in the "scripts and languages" topic map that comes with
the engine distribution.

<p>
Each topic is here printed using the <tt class="methodname">toString</tt>
method, and that is, as you can see, not a great help in this case.
The problem is that all the information it provides is an
automatically generated ID and the item identifier of the topic. We
will improve on this result later, however.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N102D1">3.4. Topic names and their variants</a>
</h3>



<p>
One part of the API that many find confusing at first is the
representation of topic names and variants. As mentioned earlier, both
are represented by objects that implement the
<tt class="interfacename">TopicNameIF</tt> interface, but variant names
have their own interface derived from this, which is called
<tt class="interfacename">VariantNameIF</tt>. In both cases, the
<tt class="symbol">variants</tt> property contains the
<tt class="symbol">variant</tt> children of the object.
</p>


<p>
In the XTM 1.0 syntax the <tt class="symbol">variant</tt> element name does
not have a <tt class="symbol">scope</tt> child, but instead contains a
<tt class="symbol">parameters</tt> child. However,
<tt class="symbol">parameters</tt> has the same semantics as
<tt class="symbol">scope</tt>, and so what is contained in the
<tt class="symbol">scope</tt> property of a variant name is its parameters.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N102FB">3.5. Creating topic maps</a>
</h3>



<p>
Quite often one may want to either add data to an existing topic map,
or to process data in some other format to automatically generate a
topic map from it. To do this one needs to create new topic map
objects and insert them into a topic map. If no topic map exists
already one will also have to be created.
</p>


<p>
To create a topic map in the in-memory implementation create an
instance of the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.basic.InMemoryTopicMapStore</tt>
class. This class has a constructor with no arguments. Once that is
done you have a topic map object, and are ready to start filling it
with data. You will not be able to do this by instantiating topic map
objects from the same package directly. The reason is that by doing so
you are tying your code directly to one engine implementation, and by
letting you do so we would be limiting our own freedom in terms of
implementation strategies.
</p>


<p>
Instead, the solution is to use the
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapBuilderIF</tt> object available from
the <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapIF</tt> interface. The builder
will let you create new topic map objects, and offers you some
convenience methods for creating and configuring objects in a single
method call, which makes building a bit easier.
</p>


<p>Many methods in the API take
<tt class="interfacename">LocatorIF</tt> arguments, and it may not be
obvious how to create such objects. A straightforward approach is to
use the constructor on the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.infoset.impl.basic.URILocator</tt> class
and pass in the URI as a string. Another approch is to use the
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.QNameRegistry</tt> class
to create the locators via qnames (such as
<tt class="literal">"tmdm:topic-name"</tt>).</p>


<p>
Below is an example program that creates a topic map with topics for
the numbers 1-10 and exports it to XTM format.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.*;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.basic.InMemoryTopicMapStore;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMTopicMapWriter;

public class Generate {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    TopicMapStoreIF store = new InMemoryTopicMapStore();
    TopicMapIF topicmap = store.getTopicMap();

    TopicMapBuilderIF builder = topicmap.getBuilder();
    for (int ix = 1; ix &lt; 11; ix++) {
      // add topic to topic map
      TopicIF topic = builder.makeTopic(topicmap);

      // builder adds topic name to topic and sets name string
      builder.makeTopicName(topic, Integer.toString(ix));
    }

    // having created the topic map we are now ready to export it
    new XTMTopicMapWriter("numbers.xtm").write(topicmap);
  }

}
</pre>
</code>


<p>
Note that an alternative approach when creating topic maps is to use
the LTM format to create small fragments which can be imported into
the topic map. This can be much simpler than using the API directly.
Below is an example that does the same thing using this approach.
</p>


<code>
<pre>import java.io.StringReader;
import java.io.IOException;

import net.ontopia.infoset.impl.basic.URILocator;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.*;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ltm.LTMTopicMapReader;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMTopicMapWriter;

public class GenerateLTM {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    String seed = "[number = \"Number\"]";
    URILocator base = new URILocator("http://www.example.com");
    LTMTopicMapReader reader = new LTMTopicMapReader(new StringReader(seed), base);
    
    TopicMapIF topicmap = reader.read();
    for (int ix = 1; ix &lt; 11; ix++) {
      String fragment = "[t" + ix + " : number = \"" + ix + "\"]";
      reader = new LTMTopicMapReader(new StringReader(fragment), base);
      reader.importInto(topicmap);
    }

    // having created the topic map we are now ready to export it
    new XTMTopicMapWriter("numbers.xtm").write(topicmap);
  }
}</pre>
</code>


<p>
In an example this simple the code isn't much simpler (though note
that the LTM example does more than the API example), but in a real
example the difference can be quite substantial once you have utility
methods to read in the LTM. (And if you use a scripting language like
Jython the difference can become dramatic, since it's much easier to
produce the string fragments in such a language.)
</p>





<h2>
<a name="N10332">4. More about the utilities</a>
</h2>



<p>
This section provides additional information about the topic map
utility package (<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils</tt>).  The
discussions below not only provide information about individual
utilities, but hopefully also insight into the general design and
coding style used throughout the Ontopia code.
</p>


<p>
In general, the philosophy behind the design of the engine has been
for the core interfaces to only represent the data in a topic map and
to leave all other functionality to be built on top of these core
interfaces. This means that functionality like association traversal,
merging, information lookup and so on has all been placed in packages
outside the core interfaces. The implementations of these utilities
are independent of specific topic map implementations where possible,
and the interfaces to the functionality are always independent of the
particular implementation used.
</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10342">4.1. Stringifiers</a>
</h3>



<p>
Stringifiers are objects which implement the
<tt class="interfacename">StringifierIF</tt> interface in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.utils</tt> package. This means that it can
take any object and return a string value somehow derived from the
state of this object.
</p>


<p>
The most common use of stringifiers is to extract the name of a
topic. This operation is actually quite complex, since topic maps
allow topics to have arbitrarily many names of different kinds.  In
the <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils</tt> package there is a
class named <tt class="classname">TopicStringifiers</tt> with three
different methods that create stringifiers for topics. These
stringifiers can then be used to extract the names of any topic. (See
the javadoc for further details.)
</p>


<p>
This allows us to extend our previous TopicsOfType example application
to print the names of topics, and the source code of this improved
version is given below.
</p>


<code>
<pre>import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Collection;

import net.ontopia.infoset.core.LocatorIF;

import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.TopicStringifiers;
import net.ontopia.utils.StringifierIF;

public class TopicsOfType2 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      printTopicsOfType(new File(args[0]), args[1]);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("ERROR reading topic map: " + e);
    }
  }

  public static void printTopicsOfType(File tmfile, String typeId)
    throws IOException {
    TopicMapReaderIF reader = ImportExportUtils.getReader(tmfile);
    TopicMapIF tm = reader.read();

    TopicIF topicType = getTopicByXMLId(tm, typeId);
    if (topicType == null) {
      System.err.println("ERROR: No such topic: " + typeId);
      return;
    }

    StringifierIF stringifier = TopicStringifiers.getDefaultStringifier();
    Iterator it = tm.getTopics().iterator();
    while (it.hasNext()) {
      TopicIF topic = (TopicIF) it.next();
      Collection types = topic.getTypes();
      if (types.contains(topicType))
        System.out.println(stringifier.toString(topic));
    }
  }

  private static TopicIF getTopicByXMLId(TopicMapIF tm, String id) {
    TopicMapStoreIF store = tm.getStore();
    LocatorIF loc = store.getBaseAddress().resolveAbsolute("#" + id);
    return (TopicIF) tm.getObjectByItemIdentifier(loc);
  }

}</pre>
</code>


<p>
This new and improved version now produces the output below (for the
same topics that the previous version printed). Note that these names
are all basenames in the unconstrained scope, since these are the
default names for the topics.

<h3>
<a name="N10366">4.2. Logging</a>
</h3>



<p> The logging support in the engine is based on the
<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">Simple Logging Facade for Java
(SLF4J)</a>, which makes it possible to use any logging tool
supported by SLF4J for the actual logging. By default, Ontopia
uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">log4j</a>,
an open source logging package developed as part of the Jakarta Apache
project. For the engine to properly log its runtime messages log4j
needs to be configured. If it is not properly configured the first log
statement will output an error message like the following to the
console.</p>


<pre>
log4j:ERROR No appenders could be found for category (net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.AbstractTopicMapContentHandler).
log4j:ERROR Please initialize the log4j system properly.
</pre>


<p>
To avoid this problem one needs to configure log4j properly. The
easiest way to do this and get a sensible default is to call the
<tt class="methodname">configure</tt> method of the
<tt class="classname">org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator</tt> class.  You
can also use the <tt class="classname">PropertyConfigurator</tt> class to
load a property file with the log4j configuration. Given the right
<tt class="symbol">import</tt> statements, the code would go something like
this:
</p>


<pre>
BasicConfigurator.configure();
PropertyConfigurator.configure("log4j.properties");
</pre>


<p>
To learn how log4j works and other mechanisms for configuring logging
see <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/manual.html">the
log4j manual</a>. In order to switch to a different logging engine
than log4j, all that's necessary is to replace the jar file that binds
SLF4J to log4j with one that binds to another logging engine.
See <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html">the SLF4J manual</a>
for further details.
</p>


<p>
More complete documentation of the logging conventions used by the
engine and recommendations for how to configure logging will be added

<h3>
<a name="N1039D">4.3. The event API</a>
</h3>



<p>
Some applications may want to be informed when changes are made to the
topic map, and the event API enables this by allowing applications to
register in order to receive method callbacks on changes to the topic
map. The API is in the <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.events</tt>,
which contains an interface event listeners must implement
(<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapListenerIF</tt>) and
a class for registering listeners (<tt class="classname">TopicMapEvents</tt>).
</p>


<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd>
  
<p>At the moment there are three events: topic added, topic
  modified and topic deleted. The API will be extended with support
  for more events as these are needed.</p>

</dd>
</dl>


<p>
A simple example command-line application using the event API is given
below.
</p>


<pre>import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TMObjectIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapBuilderIF;

import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.DeletionUtils;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.SameStoreFactory;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ImportExportUtils;

public class EventTest {

  public static void main(String[] argv) throws java.io.IOException {
    // import the topic map, whichever one it is
    TopicMapIF tm = ImportExportUtils.getReader(argv[0]).read();

    // the API requires a reference, so we have to perform some extra
    // steps here; in web applications this is easy (see event API
    // javadoc)
    SameStoreFactory ssf = new SameStoreFactory(tm.getStore());
    TopicMapReferenceIF ref = new StoreFactoryReference("test", "test", ssf);

    // register to listen for events
    TestListener listener = new TestListener();
    TopicMapEvents.addTopicListener(ref, listener);

    // get the store through the reference so the listener is registered
    ref.createStore(false);

    // let's add a topic
    System.out.println("Off we go");
    TopicMapBuilderIF builder = tm.getBuilder();
    TopicIF newbie = builder.makeTopic(tm);
    System.out.println("Let's name this topic");
    builder.makeTopicName(newbie, "Newbie topic");

    // then let's remove it
    System.out.println("And now, the exit");
    DeletionUtils.remove(newbie);
    System.out.println("Goodbye, short-lived topic");
  }

  // ----- Listener

  static class TestListener extends AbstractTopicMapListener {

    public void objectAdded(TMObjectIF snapshot) {
      System.out.println("Topic added: " + snapshot.getObjectId());
    }

    public void objectModified(TMObjectIF snapshot) {
      System.out.println("Topic modified: " + snapshot.getObjectId());
    }

    public void objectRemoved(TMObjectIF snapshot) {
      System.out.println("Topic removed: " + snapshot.getObjectId());
    }
  }
}</pre>


<p>
The result of running it on the command-line is shown below:
</p>


<pre>[larsga@dhcp-98 tmp]$ java EventTest bkclean.xtm 
Off we go
Topic added: 3409
Let's name this topic
Topic modified: 3409
Topic modified: 3409
And now, the exit
Topic removed: 3409
Goodbye, short-lived topic</pre>


<p>
Pay careful attention to the order in which the lines appear in the
output, and you'll see that the topic added event occurs
<em>before</em> the <tt class="methodname">makeTopic</tt>
method returns. There are some consequences of this, but before we go
into them you should note that the in-memory and RDBMS implementations
behave differently on this point, as described below.
</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>In the in-memory implementation events are dispatched
    immediately as we're effectively running in auto-commit mode. For
    the add event this means that events will arrive before anything
    is known about the topic except the object ID.  That is, if
    identities or names are added, they haven't been added yet, which
    can cause difficulties. Note that this behaviour can result in
    multiple topic modified events.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>In the RDBMS implementation events are dispatched when the
    transaction is committed, because before the commit it is not yet
    known whether the change is permanent. This means that topics will
    typically arrive with at least a basic set of information
    attached, which makes things easier. Only one topic modified event
    should be issued per topic per transaction.</p>
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The one thing you can rely on always getting is the object ID of the
topic. 
</p>


<p>
Another consideration to note is that the objects you receive through
the event API are <em>not</em> the same objects that exist
in the topic map itself. This is for two reasons. The first is that
deleted objects contain no useful information, and so passing them
through the event API is not very helpful. The second is that the
event API does not know which transaction (if any) the listeners are
operating in, and so it needs to avoid making assumptions about this.
Therefore, the object passed through the callbacks are dead snapshot
objects that live outside any transaction. The object graph can be
traversed a little way out from the initial topic, but will soon stop
in stub objects.
</p>


<p>
The way to handle this is to use the object IDs to look up the
corresponding objects in the topic map in order to get the complete
information about them.
</p>


<p>
You can choose whether to implement
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapListenerIF</tt> directly or subclass
<tt class="classname">AbstractTopicMapListener</tt>. Subclassing is
recommended as this is more future-proof as any new methods that gets
added to the listener interface will then be automatically be picked
up by your listener implementation. The advantage is that you then
don't have to extend and recompile the class before a software
upgrade. The abstract listener class implements all event methods, but
none of them do anything.

<h2>
<a name="N103EF">5. Sources and references</a>
</h2>



<p>
The <tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.entry</tt> package contains
interfaces and classes that are very useful for applications that
wants to work with topic maps found in different kinds of locations.
This section provides more information on this package.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N103FA">5.1. Locating topic maps&mdash;the entry package</a>
</h3>



<p>
The entry architecture itself is very simple. It contains two
interfaces: <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt> and
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapReferenceIF</tt>.
</p>


<p>
A topic map source is used to locate a collection of topic maps, topic
map references to be presice. The source will look in a place that is
specific to each implementation of the interface and generate a list
of the topic maps to be found there. The location can be a database, a
directory on disk or somewhere else. The
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt> interface has only one
method, <tt class="methodname">getReferences</tt>, which returns the
references that was found in the location(s) known to the source.
</p>


<p> Each of the topic map references (that is,
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapReferenceIF</tt> objects) is a
reference to a topic map store, and thus also indirectly to a topic
map. You can ask the reference for a new topic map store instance by
calling the <tt class="methodname">createStore(boolean)</tt> method. The
store is not open by default. This avoids unnecessary use of resources
like database connections and memory.</p>


<p>
The rationale for having a separate topic map reference object is that
applications need to be able to work with available topic maps without
actually creating any transactions for the individual topic
maps.
</p>


<p>
A topic map reference has two additional properties: id and title.
Ids can be used to identify individual references and titles gives the
application labels usable for display. The title property is useful,
since it allows applications to get a display name without accessing
the topic map itself. Where the title comes from is up to the
reference implementation to decide.
</p>


<p>
To make this discussion a bit more complete we will now develop an
example that shows how to use these interfaces. The
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.xml.XTMPathTopicMapSource</tt>
class is an implementation of
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt> that is capable of
locating and retrieving references to XTM files. It searches a
directory for files matching a given filter.
</p>


<p>
The following code snippet uses an
<tt class="classname">XTMPathTopicMapSource</tt> to locate XTM files (with
the suffix <tt>.xtm</tt>), in the /ontopia/topicmaps
directory. The first reference is retrieved and resolved to get at the
actual topic map object.
</p>


<code>
<pre>
    // Create and configure the source
    XTMPathTopicMapSource source = new XTMPathTopicMapSource();
    source.setPath("/ontopia/topicmaps");
    source.setSuffix(".xtm");

    // Retrieve all the references
    Collection refs = source.getReferences();
    System.out.println(refs.size() + " topicmap references found.");

    // Resolve the first reference
    TopicMapReferenceIF ref = (TopicMapReferenceIF) refs.iterator().next();

    // Get the topic map
    TopicMapIF topicmap = ref.createStore(false).getTopicMap();
</pre>
</code>



<h3>
<a name="N10436">5.2. Extensible source configuration</a>
</h3>



<p>
In the entry package there is a utility class called
<tt class="classname">XMLConfigSource</tt>, which can be useful when
building topic map applications.
<tt class="classname">XMLConfigSource</tt> is an implementation of
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt>, which reads an XML
file containing other source configurations.
</p>


<p>
Applications using this class is able to separate out the source
configurations, so that applications don't have to be updated every
time new sources become available. See the javadoc of
<tt class="classname">net.ontopia.topicmaps.entry.XMLConfigSource</tt> for
complete documentation.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1044E">5.3. The topic map repository</a>
</h3>



<p> The <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt> interface
provides a rather awkward interface to the topic maps it holds, as it
only lets you iterate over the topic maps in sequence. The
<tt class="interfacename">TopicMapRepositoryIF</tt>, on the other
hand, wraps the <tt class="interfacename">TopicMapSourceIF</tt> to
provide a more convenient interface. Using this, you can add as many
sources as you want, to be managed by the repository. You can look the
references up by reference key, refresh all your sources at the same
time, and so on.  </p>



<h3>
<a name="N10460">5.4. Transactional behaviour</a>
</h3>



<p>
Although the interfaces for accessing and modifying topic maps are
designed to handle transactions correctly this does not mean that all
implementations are transactional. In particular, the in-memory topic
map implementation is not transactional, and unless you are using the
RDBMS backend, this is the implementation you will be working with.
This means that although you can modify the topic maps the
<tt class="methodname">commit</tt> and <tt class="methodname">rollback</tt>
methods have no effect.
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N10470">6. General policies</a>
</h2>



<p>
During development of the engine, a number of policies were decided on
in order to deal with the many problematic aspects of maintaining
topic maps as object structures. Some of these policies are actively
maintained by the engine, others are just design decisions made, which
developers using the engine should be aware of. This section contains
the only documentation of these policies, since there is no natural
place to keep this documentation in the javadoc.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10478">6.1. Deletion</a>
</h3>



<p>
Deleting objects from a topic map object structure is difficult
because topic maps are so strongly interconnected and it can be
difficult to avoid leaving the topic map in an inconsistent state.
The approach taken by the engine is that certain objects are owned, or
contained, by others. The topic map contains the topics and
associations in it. A topic contains its characteristics (except
association roles), a topic name contains its variants, and an
association contains its roles.  This concept of containment is made
use of in deletion in that when an object is deleted all its contained
objects, or children, will be deleted together with it.
</p>


<p>
A special problem, however, is presented by topics, to which there may
be any number of references throughout the topic map. A topic may
appear as the type (or class) of another object or in a scope, plus
that it may participate in associations. In these cases the policy of
the engine is to throw an exception. In order to remove such topics
they must removed from all its current uses as a type or in a scope in
the topic map. The class <tt class="classname">DeletionUtils</tt> in
<tt class="interfacename">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils</tt> can be used
to remove such topics by also removing all their uses.
</p>


<p>
Note that there is a special case when a topic plays a role in an
association, since in this case the association role is a child of the
association, but one would intuitively expect it to be a child of the
topic as well and one certainly can't delete the topic without
deleting the association role. Because of this
<tt class="methodname">removeTopic</tt> will reject removal of such
topics, although the opposite, removing the association, works just
fine, and will cause the role to be removed from the topic as well.
(The <tt class="classname">DeletionUtils</tt> class provides functionality
for deleting a topic together with all its associations.)
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10493">6.2. Merging</a>
</h3>


<p>
Similar problems exist with regards to the merging of topics in that
there are certain conditions under which the standard requires that
topics be merged. Merging topics in an object structure, however, is
not a safe operation, since it will inevitably leave some objects dead
and no longer usable, and in ways that may surprise developers. The
policy followed by the engine is instead to deny any operation which
would have caused two topics to merge.
</p>


<p>
This means that any attempt to do any of the following will cause a
<tt>UniquenessViolationException</tt> to be
thrown by the engine:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
    
<p>setting the subject locator of one topic to the
subject locator of another topic already in the topic map,</p>
    
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>adding a subject identifier to a topic when another topic in the
topic map already has it as a subject identifier,</p>
    
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>adding a subject identifier to a topic when another topic in the
topic map already has it as an item identifier,</p>
    
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>adding an item identifier to an object when another object in the
topic map already has that item identifier, and</p>
    
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>adding an item identifier to a topic when a topic in the topic map
already has the same URI as its subject identifier,</p>
    
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>
In addition to these constraints a
<tt>ConstraintViolationException</tt> will be
raised if any of these properties are modified on an object that is
not attached to a topic map. This is because in these cases there is
no way to test whether the modification is allowed or not.
</p>


<p>
If the application really does want to merge two topics that exist in
the same topic map the class <tt class="classname">MergeUtils</tt> in the
<tt class="symbol">net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils</tt> can be used to do this.
It will take care to also deal with all references to the topic that
is discarded in the merge.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N104DC">6.3. Duplicate suppression</a>
</h3>



<p>
According to the topic map standard certain duplicate objects are to
be removed when loading in a topic map from an XTM document. It is
tempting to also translate this into a policy to be maintained by the
engine, but our current view is that this would be much too costly,
and so at the moment the engine simply ignores any duplicates.
</p>


<p>
If you do wish to remove duplicates you can do so by using the
<tt class="classname">DuplicateSuppressionUtils</tt>. This allows you to
remove duplicates at any level in your application.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N104EB">6.4. Moving objects</a>
</h3>



<p>
In the Ontopia Topic Map Engine all objects have references to the
parents that contain them. This means that if an object is contained
by another and application code then attempts to add that object to a
second container a problem will arise. Firstly, the object can only
have one parent, and, secondly, difficult-to-trace problems may occur
if an object is contained in two containers and then modified in one
of them.
</p>


<p>
The engine handles this by denying the add operation if the object to
be added is already contained by another object. This means that if a
topic name is attached to one topic and an application wants to move it
to another topic it must first remove the topic name from the topic it
is already attached to. The exception that is thrown is the
<tt>ConstraintViolationException</tt>.
</p>
      
<p>
A related issue arises when applications attempt to insert topics from
one implementation into another. Since implementations are required to
work behind the core interfaces this will generally not work and may
fail in surprising ways. The engine does currently not test for these
situations, however.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N104FD">6.5. Collections policy</a>
</h3>



<p>
There are two subtleties to be aware of with the collections returned
from the core APIs. The first is that all collections are
unmodifiable, so any attempt to add new elements or remove elements
from the collections will fail. The reason is that we want your code
to use our <tt class="symbol">addXxx</tt> and <tt class="symbol">removeXxx</tt>
methods instead, so that we can fire internal events needed to keep
the object model consistent.
</p>


<p>
The other subtlety is that the collections returned are "live", which
means that the following code will fail with a
<tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt>:
</p>


<pre>
Iterator it = topic.getOccurrences().iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
  OccurrenceIF occ = (OccurrenceIF) it.next();
  if (occ.getType().equals(sometype))
    topic.removeOccurrence(occ);
}
</pre>


<p>
The reason is that the <tt class="methodname">removeOccurrence</tt>
method removes the occurrence from the same collection that the
collection returned by <tt class="methodname">getOccurrence</tt> is
connected to. The correct implementation is as follows:
</p>


<pre>
Iterator it = new ArrayList(topic.getOccurrences()).iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
  OccurrenceIF occ = (OccurrenceIF) it.next();
  if (occ.getType().equals(sometype))
    topic.removeOccurrence(occ);
}
</pre>
