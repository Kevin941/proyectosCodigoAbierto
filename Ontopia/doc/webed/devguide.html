<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This document explains how to set up a new web editor application from
scratch, and how to create web editor applications using the Web
Editor Framework. Its goal is to teach you the main concepts in the
framework so that you can develop your own applications using only the
reference documents for support.
</p>


<p>
Since the Web Editor Framework is an extension of the Navigator
Framework it is assumed that you are already familiar with the
Navigator Framework. If you are not, you are recommended to start with
the <cite>Navigator Framework Developer's Guide</cite>
before continuing with this document.

<h2>
<a name="N10029">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>
The Web Editor Framework is a JSP-based framework for developing web
applications where the users can modify the contents of a topic map
using a forms-based interface. This is done by writing JSP pages which
produce HTML pages containing ordinary HTML forms. These forms and the
fields in them are connected to <dfn>actions</dfn> on the
server side which are triggered when the form is submitted.
</p>


<p>
The actions triggered by a submitted form can create new constructs in
the topic map, delete old ones, modify existing ones, and generally do
anything you want. The Web Editor Framework comes with an extensive
library of actions, documented in <cite>The Web Editor Framework:
Action Library Reference</cite>. In addition, you can easily
develop your own and use them in your applications.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N1003A">1.1. Overview of concepts</a>
</h3>



<p>
In order to get an overview of how the web editor framework actually
works, let's walk through one editing operation to see what happens at
each stage of the process. The first step is that the user selects a
page in the web application, which is then generated in the same
way that it would be with the navigator framework. The diagram below
shows how this happens.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="create-page.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 1. Editor page generated</b>
</p>


<p>
The diagram above shows a page being generated by a JSP page on the
server and loaded into the browser, where it consists of three form
fields and a button. Each of the three form fields is connected with a
topic map object on the server-side, in this case a topic name, a
topic, and an occurrence. The objects are passed as
<dfn>parameters</dfn> to the actions, and the framework
keeps track of the correspondence between input field names and
actions+parameters on the server side.
</p>


<p>
The next step after this is for the user to edit the information in
the form, and then press the "Submit" button. When this happens, the
form is submitted back to the <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt> in
the web editor framework, which handles the processing of the form.
This is done as shown in the diagram below.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="receive-form.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 2. Receiving a submitted form</b>
</p>


<p>
The ProcessServlet when receiving the form will invoke the
<dfn>action group</dfn> that is connected with the form
and pass the form data as well as the parameters provided by the page
to the action group. The actions will then be invoked, modifying the
topic map, and that completes the editing operation.
</p>


<p>
There is, however, one more step, and that is to decide what page the
user is going to see now. The forwarding logic of the web editor
framework is used to decide this, based on configuration provided by
the developer. (More on this later.)
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N1006F">2. Writing an example application</a>
</h2>



<p>
Now that the key concepts involved in developing applications with the
web editor framework have been introduced we will move on to show how
you can build such applications by developing an example.
</p>


<p>
In order to keep the application simple we will be developing an
editor for a topic map that is essentially a project plan, consisting
of tasks to be performed, and information about these. For each task,
we have a name, tasks it depends on, a person responsible for the
task, a deadline date, and a priority. The editing application will
allow you to add new tasks, change existing tasks, and so on.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N1007A">2.1. Setting up the application</a>
</h3>



<p>
Before we can start building the application, however, we have to set
up the environment in which it is to run. We will walk through this
step by step, and the diagram below shows a graphical view of the
structure we will create.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="skeleton-file-structure.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 3. The directory structure</b>
</p>


<p>
The first step is to create the directory shown as 'webapp' in the
diagram, a directory called
<tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/tasked</tt>, and inside it,
another called <tt>WEB-INF</tt>. The next step is to copy
and paste the example below into a file called
<tt>web.xml</tt> and to put this in the
<tt>WEB-INF</tt> directory.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A minimal web.xml file</b>
</p>


<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app
          PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
          "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd"&gt;

&lt;web-app&gt;        

  &lt;display-name&gt;TaskEditor&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Simple example topic map web editor application.&lt;/description&gt;

  &lt;!-- General web application initialization parameters --&gt;

  &lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;log4j_config&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;../omnigator/WEB-INF/config/log4j.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      Tells the web editor where to find the log4j configuration file.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/context-param&gt;

  &lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;app_config&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/config/application.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      Tells the web editor where to find the application configuration file.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/context-param&gt;

  &lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;action_config&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/config/actions.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      Tells the web editor where to find the action configuration file.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/context-param&gt;

  &lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;source_config&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;../omnigator/WEB-INF/config/tm-sources.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      Tells the web editor where to find the topic map
      sources configuration file.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/context-param&gt;

  &lt;!-- Declare servlets --&gt;

  &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;WebEditorProcessServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Controller Servlet getting in all requests&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.servlets.ProcessServlet
    &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;/servlet&gt;

  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;WebEditorProcessServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/process&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

  
  &lt;!-- Session parameters for this web application --&gt;
  &lt;session-config&gt;
    &lt;session-timeout&gt;30&lt;/session-timeout&gt;&lt;!-- in minutes --&gt;
  &lt;/session-config&gt;


  &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
    &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
    &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.html&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
  &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;

&lt;/web-app&gt;
</pre>




<p>
The next step is to create the start page for the application. A first
version of this page is given below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The index.jsp page</b>
</p>


<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;The task editor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the task editor!&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>



<p>
At this point you can start the Tomcat server and connect to <a href="http://localhost:8080/tasked/">http://localhost:8080/tasked/</a>
to see the start page.
</p>


<p>
The next step is to make sure that we have the necessary configuration
and are able to load the topic map. To do this, create a directory
called <tt>WEB-INF/config</tt>, then put the contents of
the example below into a file called <tt>application.xml</tt>.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A minimal application.xml file</b>
</p>



<pre>
&lt;configuration type="application"&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;property name="defaultCharacterEncoding" value="utf-8"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="allowLoadOnRequest" value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>



<p>
Once this is done, the next step is to check if the
<tt>tasks.ltm</tt> file is present in 
<tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/topicmaps</tt>, since we have told our web
application to get its topic maps from there (by using the omnigator 
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt>). Now everything is ready, and we can 
start using the tag libraries.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N100DF">2.2. The start page</a>
</h3>


<p>
The first step is to update the <tt>index.jsp</tt> page as
shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The new index.jsp page</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="tasks.ltm"&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The task editor&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The task editor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="create-task.jsp"&gt;Create new task&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($TASK, task)?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="task.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="TASK"/&gt;"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="TASK"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td valign=top&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="create-person.jsp"&gt;Create new person&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($PERSON, person)?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="person.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="PERSON"/&gt;"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="PERSON"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>



<p>
So far we have only created an ordinary navigator application, and the
time has now come to start making this into a web editor application.
The first step would be to implement the page for editing individual
people, which is what we do in the next section.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N100FA">2.3. The person.jsp page</a>
</h3>



<p>
Once this is set up we are ready to create the page for editing
"person" topics. The contents of this page are shown in the example
below. (Note that it cannot be loaded before we have added one more
file.)
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The person.jsp page</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/webed' prefix='webed' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="tasks.ltm"&gt;
  &lt;tolog:set var="person" reqparam="id"/&gt;
  &lt;tolog:set var="name" query="topic-name(%person%, $NAME)?"/&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Editing '&lt;tolog:out var="person"/&gt;'&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Editing '&lt;tolog:out var="person"/&gt;'&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;webed:form actiongroup="person"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name 
  &lt;webed:field action="set-name" params="name person" type="tfs"&gt;
    &lt;tolog:if var="name"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="name"/&gt;&lt;/tolog:if&gt;
  &lt;/webed:field&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;webed:button action="person"        text="Change"/&gt;
&lt;webed:button action="delete-person" text="Delete" params="person"/&gt;

&lt;/webed:form&gt;
&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>



<p>
The interesting parts of this page are the <tt class="symbol">webed</tt> tags
which set up the form used to change the name of the person. The main
tag is the <tt class="symbol">webed:form</tt> tag, which creates the form in
which all of the components are placed. The <tt class="symbol">actiongroup</tt>
attribute gives the name of the action group which will handle the
form when it is submitted. This action group is declared in the
<tt>actions.xml</tt> file, which will be explained shortly.
</p>


<p>
The next part of interest is the <tt class="symbol">webed:field</tt> tag,
which creates a text input field. The content of the tag produces the
initial content of the field, and the value that the user writes there
will be set as the new value of the name. The <tt class="symbol">action</tt>
attribute gives the name of the action which will handle this form
field when the form is submitted (the <tt class="symbol">set-name</tt> action
is declared in the actions file), while the <tt class="symbol">type</tt>
attribute tells the tag what template to use for this field (also
declared in the actions file).
</p>


<p>
A very important attribute is the <tt class="symbol">params</tt> attribute
which contains the names of variables that will be passed to the
action when the form is submitted. The first parameter holds the base
name that is to be modified. This is necessary in order for the action
to know <em>which</em> topic name to modify. The second
parameter holds the topic that owns the topic name in case the base
name has not been created yet. The action will then create a new base
name, but will need to know what topic to attach it to.
</p>


<p>
Finally, we produce two buttons for the user to press. Each of these
have actions associated with them (given in the
<tt class="symbol">action</tt> attribute) as well as objects (in the
<tt class="symbol">params</tt> attribute) and a label for the button (in the
<tt class="symbol">text</tt> attribute). The first button submits the changed
page to the editor, while the second button deletes the current topic.
(This is why the second button needs the current topic as a parameter:
it needs to know what topic to delete.)
</p>


<p>
The result, once we add the actions file, will be the page shown in
the diagram below.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="person.gif">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 4. Editing a person</b>
</p>


<p>
The last piece necessary to make this work is the
<tt>actions.xml</tt> file, to be added to the
<tt>WEB-INF/config</tt> directory as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The actions.xml file</b>

    &lt;class shortcut="AssignRolePlayer"
           fullname="net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.association.AssignRolePlayer"/&gt;
  &lt;/classMap&gt;


  &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  &lt;/fieldMap&gt;

  &lt;/globalForwards&gt;

    &lt;action name="set-name" class="ActionSetBasenameValue"/&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- principal actions --&gt;
    &lt;action name="person"        class="DummyAction"/&gt;
    &lt;action name="delete-person" class="ActionDelete" exclusive="true"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define forward rules --&gt;
    &lt;forwardRules&gt;
      &lt;forwardDefault path="person.jsp"/&gt;
      &lt;forwardRule action="delete-person" forward="frontpage"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
  &lt;/actionGroup&gt;
  
&lt;/actionConfig&gt;
</pre>



<p>
The first part of the file (the <tt class="symbol">classMap</tt>) declares
shorter names for the Java classes used in the rest of the file. After
this comes a declaration of the field types referenced from the
<tt class="symbol">webed:field</tt> tag (the <tt class="symbol">fieldMap</tt> part).
</p>


<p>
After this follows global forwarding rules used by the
<tt class="symbol">ProcessServlet</tt> to decide where to send the user in
cases where the action group does not declare explicit rules. In this
case the only declaration we have is that the
<tt class="symbol">frontpage</tt> name is an alias for the
<tt class="symbol">index.jsp</tt> page. The idea with this is that it makes
it possible to change the front page without having to change all
forwarding rules that point to this page in the whole application.
</p>


<p>
Finally comes the declaration of the action group which corresponds to
our page for editing "person" topics. The first declares our input
field and maps it to the <tt class="symbol">ActionSetBasenameValue</tt>
action.  This action takes a topic name object and sets its string
value to that passed from the input field when the form is submitted.
</p>


<p>
The next is two actions, which correspond to the two buttons we
declared. The first is the <tt class="symbol">DummyAction</tt>, which is
used for the "Submit" button, and which does nothing (the other
actions take care of everything when you press this button). The
second is the <tt class="symbol">ActionDelete</tt>, which deletes a topic
from the topic map.
</p>


<p>
Note that the <tt class="symbol">delete-person</tt> action has been defined
as <dfn>exclusive</dfn>. What this means is that if this
action is triggered only it should run, and no other actions. This
ensures that we don't waste time updating a topic that is to be
deleted anyway, and also avoids problems if the
<tt class="symbol">delete-person</tt> action is not executed last (the other
actions will then attempt to update objects which are no longer
there). The last problem could be solved in this case by placing the
action last in the group (since actions are executed in the order they
are given), but this is not always possible.
</p>


<p>
Finally, we have the forwarding rules. The default is for the user to
get the same <tt>person.jsp</tt> page back, but if the
<tt class="symbol">delete-person</tt> action is triggered we go to the front
page instead.
</p>


<p>
And that's it. This is a complete page for editing topics of a
particular type. You've now seen the main parts of the framework, and
the rest of this guide is just about how to handle more kinds of
situations. 
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N101A6">2.4. Creating people and tasks</a>
</h3>



<p>
The next step is to make it possible to create new people. To do this
we need to modify the start page so that we can trigger action groups
on the server that contain the necessary actions. This is done by
creating little forms whose buttons trigger create actions. The new
start page is shown below.
</p>

  &lt;tolog:declare&gt;
    using t for s"#"
  &lt;/tolog:declare&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The task editor&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The task editor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;webed:form actiongroup="create-task"&gt;
        &lt;webed:button action="create-task" params="topicmap t:task"
                      text="Create task"/&gt;
      &lt;/webed:form&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($TASK, task)?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="task.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="TASK"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="TASK"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td valign=top&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;webed:form actiongroup="create-person"&gt;
        &lt;webed:button action="create-person" params="topicmap t:person" 
                      text="Create person"/&gt;
      &lt;/webed:form&gt;
  &lt;tolog:foreach query="instance-of($PERSON, person)?"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="person.jsp?id=&lt;tolog:id var="PERSON"/&gt;"
          &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="PERSON"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>



<p>
The only change here is that we have added buttons to create new
topics, and provided them with parameters: the containing topic map,
and the type of the new topic, in that order. Note how the second
parameter has a name beginning with <tt class="symbol">t:</tt> in both cases;
this makes use of the tolog URI prefix we declared with
<tt class="symbol">tolog:declare</tt> to refer to the topic type without
having to create a variable for it. Using this parameter we can
actually create topics that are instances of "person" and "task" as
opposed to completely blank topics.
</p>


<p>
For this to work we need to add two more action groups after the first
one in <tt>actions.xml</tt>:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Two new action groups</b>
</p>


<pre>  &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Action group for creating new people
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;
  &lt;actionGroup name="create-person"&gt;
    &lt;action name="create-person" class="ActionTopicMapCreateTopic"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define forward rules --&gt;
    &lt;forwardRules&gt;
      &lt;forwardDefault path="person.jsp"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
  &lt;/actionGroup&gt;

  &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Action group for creating new tasks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;
  &lt;actionGroup name="create-task"&gt;
    &lt;action name="create-task" class="ActionTopicMapCreateTopic"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define forward rules --&gt;
    &lt;forwardRules&gt;
      &lt;forwardDefault path="task.jsp"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
  &lt;/actionGroup&gt;</pre>



<p>
Notice how in both cases we forward the user onto the page for editing
topics of the given type, so that having created the topic we can edit
it immediately. (The framework takes care of setting the right request
parameters to pass the object ID to the editing pages.)
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N101D5">2.5. Editing tasks</a>
</h3>



<p>
The next step is to start editing tasks, and this can be done quite
easily by taking <tt>person.jsp</tt> as the starting
point. This enables us to edit the name of the task, and then we only
have to add the rest. As a first step we will add a description
occurrence and an association to the person responsible for the task.
The resulting JSP is shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The task.jsp page</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=utf-8" %&gt;

&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/tolog' prefix='tolog' %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri='http://psi.ontopia.net/jsp/taglib/webed' prefix='webed' %&gt;

&lt;tolog:context topicmap="tasks.ltm"&gt;
  &lt;tolog:set var="task" reqparam="id"/&gt;
  &lt;tolog:declare&gt;
    using t for s"#"
  &lt;/tolog:declare&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Editing '&lt;tolog:out var="task"/&gt;'&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Editing '&lt;tolog:out var="task"/&gt;'&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;webed:form actiongroup="task"&gt;

&lt;tolog:set var="name" query="topic-name(%task%, $TN)?"/&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="description" 
           query="occurrence(%task%, $OCC), type($OCC, description)?"/&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="people" query="instance-of($PERSON, person)?"/&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="person" 
           query="assigned-to(%task% : assignment, $P : responsible)?"/&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="assign-assoc"
           query="select $A from
                    role-player($R, %task%),
                    association-role($A, $R),
                    type($A, assigned-to)?"/&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;webed:field action="set-name" params="name task" type="tfs"&gt;
          &lt;tolog:if var="name"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="name"/&gt;&lt;/tolog:if&gt;
        &lt;/webed:field&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Description
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;webed:field action="set-int-occurrence" type="tfs"
                     params="description task t:description"&gt;
          &lt;tolog:if var="description"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="description"/&gt;&lt;/tolog:if&gt;
        &lt;/webed:field&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Responsible person
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
          params="assign-assoc t:assigned-to task t:assignment t:responsible"
          collection="people" selected="person"/&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;webed:button action="task"        text="Change"/&gt;
&lt;webed:button action="delete-task" text="Delete" params="task"/&gt;

&lt;/webed:form&gt;
&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>



<p>
On this page we've added a second <tt class="symbol">webed:field</tt> for the
description occurrence. This is very similar to that for the name, but
uses a different action and also adds a parameter, so that the action
can give the occurrence its type, if it has to create it for us.
</p>


<p>
The responsible person, however, is different, since in this case we
don't want a text field, but a list of alternatives. This is done with
the <tt class="symbol">webed:list</tt> tag, which is similar to
<tt class="symbol">webed:field</tt>, but adds some new things. Here, we no
longer produce the contents of the list using <tt class="symbol">tolog:*</tt>
tags, but instead pass it a variable containing the alternatives (this
is what the <tt class="symbol">collection</tt> attribute does). This is used
by the tag to produce a drop-down list. The optional
<tt class="symbol">selected</tt> attribute holds the currently selected
topic, if there is one.
</p>


<p>
The action used in this case will take an association as its object
and assign a player to a specific role, creating the association if it
does not already exist. This is why the <tt class="symbol">params</tt>
attribute contains so many values. The values are, in order, the
association type, the role player on this side, the role of this
topic, and the role of the topic being selected. This information is
used both to select the right role to assign to and also to create new
associations, if necessary.
</p>


<p>
At this point, the only thing that remains is to update the actions
file with the action group for this page, as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Action group for tasks</b>
</p>


<pre>  &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Action group for "task" topics
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;
  &lt;actionGroup name="task"&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- actions related to form input fields --&gt;
    &lt;action name="set-name"           class="ActionSetBasenameValue"/&gt;
    &lt;action name="set-int-occurrence" class="ActionSetOccValue"/&gt;
    &lt;action name="assign-player"      class="AssignRolePlayer"/&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- principal actions --&gt;
    &lt;action name="task"        class="DummyAction"/&gt;
    &lt;action name="delete-task" class="ActionDelete" exclusive="true"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define forward rules --&gt;
    &lt;forwardRules&gt;
      &lt;forwardDefault path="task.jsp"/&gt;
      &lt;forwardRule action="delete-task" forward="frontpage"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
  &lt;/actionGroup&gt;</pre>



<p>
At this point the application is usable, if not very useful. Most of
what remains is more of the same as what you have already seen, so the
design of the application from this point on will be aimed more at
showing you new aspects of the framework than at creating something
useful.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="sect-task-dependencies">2.6. Task dependencies</a>
</h3>



<p>
It should be possible for a task to have dependencies on other tasks,
and, most importantly, on any number of tasks. This means that we have
to handle this association rather differently from the association
between the task and the responsible person. It must be possible to
create new associations as well as to delete old ones. Luckily, the
<tt class="classname">AssignRolePlayer</tt> action is designed in such a
way as to make this quite easy.
</p>


<p>
Adding the following code to the <tt>task.jsp</tt> page
provides support for editing dependencies:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Editing dependencies</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;!-- set some variables --&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="tasks" query="instance-of($TASK, task), $TASK /= %task%?"/&gt;

&lt;%-- make empty variable --%&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="empty"/&gt;

&lt;!-- then produce a list of drop-down lists --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;Depends on
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;tolog:foreach query="role-player($R1, %task%), type($R1, after),
                              association-role($ASSOC, $R1),
                              association-role($ASSOC, $R2), type($R2, prior),
                              role-player($R2, $OTHER)?"&gt;

          &lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
                    params="ASSOC t:depends-on task t:after t:prior"
                    collection="tasks"
                    selected="OTHER"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;

        &lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
                  params="empty t:depends-on task t:after t:prior"
                  collection="tasks"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;</pre>



<p>
This code produces one drop-down list for each existing dependency
association and afterwards adds one more drop-down list that can be
used to create a new association. All of these lists are mapped to the
<tt class="classname">AssignRolePlayer</tt> action. In the case of the
drop-down lists for existing associations selecting a new topic will
change the association, while selecting "Unspecified" will cause the
association to be deleted. Similarly, if the user does not select a
topic in the last drop-down list no association will be created. If
the user does select one, however, an association will be created.
</p>


<p>
Note that all of this behaviour (creation, modification, and deletion
of the association) is implemented by the
<tt class="classname">AssignRolePlayer</tt> action, and if a different
action is used, the behaviour will be different. (If you need more
help on using this action, see <a href="#sect-assign-player">section
        4.4</a>.)
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N10248">3. Useful techniques</a>
</h2>



<p>
By this point we have covered the bare minimum of what is necessary to
know to create a web editor application, but there are some useful
techniques that make developing with the web editor framework easier,
and we will cover them in this section.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10250">3.1. Passing additional request parameters</a>
</h3>



<p>
In most cases the framework takes care of passing the object ID of the
current object being worked on (usually a topic) around for you, but
sometimes you need to pass more parameters. When the user submits a
form it goes to the <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt>, which
processes it, and then forwards the user on to the next page. This
means that the <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt> decides which
parameters go to the next page, and <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt>
only passes on the <tt class="symbol">id</tt> parameter, unless told to be
more permissive.
</p>


<p>
The way to do this is to change the definition of the forward rules in
the <tt>actions.xml</tt> file by adding
<tt class="symbol">reqParam</tt> elements inside the <tt class="symbol">forward</tt>
or <tt class="symbol">forwardDefault</tt> elements. The example below shows
one way of doing this:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using reqParam</b>
</p>


<pre>  &lt;forwardRules&gt;
    &lt;forwardDefault path="task.jsp"&gt;
      &lt;reqParam name="show-dependencies" value="yes"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardDefault&gt;

    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
</pre>



<p>
This will cause the default forward to go to 
<tt class="symbol">task.jsp?id=&lt;objectid&gt;&amp;show-dependencies=yes</tt>.
If you want the value of the extra parameter to be dynamic you can
leave off the <tt class="symbol">value</tt> attribute. In this case the
<tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt> will pass on the value it
receives for this parameter, or, if it doesn't receive the parameter
at all, it will leave it out entirely.
</p>


<p>
What this means is that you must remember to pass the value of
<tt class="symbol">show-dependencies</tt> to the
<tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt>.  In other words, if the user is
at
<tt class="symbol">otherpage.jsp?id=&lt;objectid&gt;&amp;show-dependencies=yes</tt>
and you have a forward like in the example above the value will
<em>not</em> be carried forward. The reason is that
although <tt class="symbol">otherpage.jsp</tt> got a value for
<tt class="symbol">show-dependencies</tt>
<tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt> did not, and so it could not
pass it on. The solution is to add the following to
<tt class="symbol">otherpage.jsp</tt>:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Passing request parameters to ProcessServlet</b>
</p>


<pre>  &lt;webed:form ...&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

    &lt;input type=hidden name=show-dependencies
           value="&lt;%= request.getParameter("show-dependencies") %&gt;"&gt;

    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;/webed:form&gt;
</pre>



<p>
This copies the value of <tt class="symbol">show-dependencies</tt> from the
current request and passes it to <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt>.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N102BA">3.2. Using LTM to create topic map content</a>
</h3>



<p>
Quite often one wants to do more than just create a topic of a
particular type, for example one that has a topic name in a particular
scope, and an association to some other topic. There are no ready-made
tasks for this, and even if there were they would need an awful lot of
parameters, and it would be really difficult to make tasks that could
cover all eventualities.  Instead, we created a task that accepts LTM
fragments and reads the LTM fragment into the topic map. This allows
you to describe what you would like to have added to the topic map in
an easy and flexible way.
</p>


<p>
For example, imagine that we want to add to the
<tt>task.jsp</tt> page the ability to create a new task
that the one being edited depends on, and to give it a name
immediately, so that the user can continue working with the current
task.
</p>


<p>
To do this, all we have to do is to add a new text field for the name
of the new task and attach it to the
<tt class="classname">EvaluateLTM</tt> task, so that if the user enters a
name the task is triggered and the new task created. To do this we add
the following to the end of the table in the
<tt>task.jsp</tt> page:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Adding the new field</b>
</p>


<pre>
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;New dependent task
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;webed:field action="evaluate" params="topicmap fragment"/&gt;
</pre>



<p>
This creates the field and sets everything up, passing the topic map
and the LTM fragment to the action, which then will read the fragment
into the topic map. We haven't yet created the fragment, however, so
we have to do that. The snippet below creates the LTM fragment, and
needs to be inserted in the page somewhere above the example above, so
that the <tt>fragment</tt> variable is defined when the code
in the example above is evaluated.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Defining an LTM fragment</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;tolog:set var="fragment"&gt;
  [%new% : task = "%value%"]
  depends-on(&lt;tolog:id of="task"/&gt; : prior, %new% : after)
&lt;/tolog:set&gt;</pre>



<p>
There are several things worthy of note here, and we'll go through
them one by one. First, the LTM fragment is a string, so we use the
<tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> tag with content to create it. The contents
of the tag form the LTM fragment, and we can use any tags we want to
produce the fragment.
</p>


<p>
We can use topic IDs to refer to topics in the topic map. This works
for topics that have source locators of the right form.
 We exploit
this to refer to the typing topics, but also to create a reference to
the current task, by using the <tt class="symbol">tolog:id</tt> tag. Note
that this requires the current task to have a source locator of the
right form, since LTM doesn't support any other form of topic
reference.
</p>


<p>
Finally, we see that the special syntax <tt class="symbol">%new%</tt> and
<tt class="symbol">%value%</tt> is being used to refer to the new topic
created by this action and the string value of the form field,
respectively. Note that neither of these have to be used, and if the
<tt class="symbol">%new%</tt> token does not appear in the fragment, no new
topic will be created when the fragment is evaluated.
</p>


<p>
The last thing we need to do to make this work is to add the
<tt class="symbol">evaluate</tt> action to the
<tt>actions.xml</tt> file, but we leave this as an
exercise for the reader.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1030D">3.3. Using tolog to delete topic map content</a>
</h3>



<p>
In some cases one wants to delete not just a single topic,
association, or occurrence, but a whole collection of objects. In this
case it needs to be made clear which objects are going to be deleted,
and this is where tolog comes in. The
<tt class="classname">TologDelete</tt> action allows you to send a tolog
query to the action, and the action will then delete all objects
selected by the query.
</p>


<p>
One example in the context of the task editor might be that we want to
delete all tasks which do not depend on any other task, nor have any
tasks that depend on them. To do this we can use a tolog query that
finds all these tasks and pass it to the
<tt class="classname">TologDelete</tt> action, as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using tolog for deletion</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;tolog:set var="query"&gt;
  select $TASK from
    instance-of($TASK, task),
    not(depends-on($PRIOR : prior, $TASK : after)),
    not(depends-on($TASK : prior, $AFTER : after))?
&lt;/tolog:set&gt;

&lt;webed:button action="delete" params="topicmap query" text="Delete"/&gt;</pre>



<p>
This is actually all it takes, except for the
<tt>actions.xml</tt> setup, which once again is left as an
exercise for the reader.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1032E">3.4. Attaching JavaScript events to form controls</a>
</h3>



<p>
Quite often it's necessary to attach a JavaScript event to a form
control in order to implement some dynamic user interface
functionality, or even to do some client-side validation of input.  In
HTML every form control has a number of such events, and the
JavaScript is typically attached by putting a method call into an HTML
attribute with the name of the event. However, when the control is
rendered with the tag library, that isn't possible. So how to solve
it?
</p>


<p>
Instead of adding one attribute for every event to the tag library,
we've chosen a simpler solution. Every tag in the tag library that
directly renders a form control, like <tt class="symbol">field</tt>,
<tt class="symbol">list</tt>, <tt class="symbol">checkbox</tt>, and
<tt class="symbol">button</tt>, has an <tt class="symbol">id</tt> attribute. This
will be reproduced in the HTML output as an ID attribute on the form
control. This can then be used to attach JavaScript event handlers to
the form control, as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using the id attribute</b>
</p>



<pre>
  &lt;webed:button action="deleteAction" text="Delete" params="topic" 
                id="delete"/&gt;

  &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
  
    function confirmDelete() {

      return confirm("Are you certain you want to delete this topic?")

    }
  
    document.getElementById("delete").onclick = confirmDelete;
  
  &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>



<p>
It really is as simple as this. The only pitfall is that you must make
sure that the <tt class="symbol">script</tt> element appears
<em>below</em> the form control, so that the element has
been parsed first.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1035B">3.5. Rendering form controls yourself</a>
</h3>



<p>
In some cases it may be necessary to take control over the rendering
of forms controls, for example because you need to control in detail
the rendering of a control. The tag libraries make this possible
through the <tt class="symbol">actionid</tt> tag, which let you pass
parameters to the framework and get a form control name back.
</p>


<p>
The example below shows how this can be used.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Rendering a list box</b>
</p>



<pre>
&lt;select name="&lt;webed:actionid action="set-role-player" 
                              params="assoc ..."/&gt;"&gt;
   &lt;tolog:foreach query="related-to(%topic% : start, $OTHER : end)?"&gt;
     &lt;option value="&lt;tolog:oid var="OTHER"/&gt;"&gt;&lt;tolog:out var="OTHER"
       scope="myscope"/&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
   &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>



<p>
This simple example creates a list box where the topics in
<tt class="symbol">myscope</tt> have been used to select the names of the
topic being shown. Otherwise it is exactly like an ordinary list
rendered by <tt class="symbol">webed:list</tt>. The magic here is performed
by the <tt class="symbol">webed:actionid</tt> tag which causes the parameters
to be bound to a form control name, which is then output. This means
that when the form is submitted the action is invoked in the usual
way.
</p>


<p>
Note that there is one important difference between controls rendered
this way, and controls rendered in the usual way. The usual controls
only cause actions to be invoked when the value of the control
changes, but since the framework does not know the initial value of a
custom-rendered control it is always invoked. We are considering to
fix this, but haven't yet done so.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10382">3.6. Searching to find topic to associate with</a>
</h3>



<p>
In most cases when editing a topic there is not too many topics that
it could be associated with, but occasionally a topic could be
associated with any one of thousands of other topics. In these cases
it's clearly not a good idea to create a drop-down list containing all
these topics. So, what to do?
</p>


<p>
A common solution is to use a pop-up dialog to search for the topic
you want to create an association to. You can create a text field
(containing the name of the associated topic, if any) with a button to
open the search pop-up next to it. Using JavaScript this can be quite
easy, once you know the trick.
</p>


<p>
Imagine we are creating a page to edit books in a library system, and
we want to make it possible to attach a new author. The author has to
be selected from thousands of person topics, which means we need to
use the search pop-up solution. The figure below shows what this might
look like.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="popup-fragment.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 5. Selecting an author</b>
</p>


<p>
The code to create this is shown below.
</p>


<pre>&lt;webed:form actiongroup="edit-book" id="edit-book"&gt;

  &lt;%-- necessary variables already set --%&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Author &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;input type=text id=author-name&gt;
      &lt;input type=hidden name="&lt;webed:actionid action="assignPlayer" 
         value="empty" params="empty o:author-of o:book o:work o:author"/&gt;"
             id=author-oid&gt;

      &lt;input type="submit" value="Choose"
             onclick="return chooser('new-author')"&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Now we've got the form controls we need, but we need to implement the
<tt>chooser</tt> JavaScript function (and we need to do it
higher up in the page than the previous fragment). That could be done
as follows.
</p>


<pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
  function chooser(field) {
    var search = '';
    if (document.forms['edit-book'][field + '-name'].value) {
      // if the user has typed something in the name field, we can use
      // that for the search
      search = '&amp;search=' + document.forms['edit-book'][field + '-name'].value;
    }

    window.open('chooser.jsp?field=' + field + search,'searchpopup','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300, height=300, screenX=30, screenY=30, left=30, right=30');
    return false; // don't submit just because we pressed this button
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>


<p>
Now we've got the form controls, and they open a new window in which
we get <tt class="symbol">chooser.jsp</tt> with the appropriate parameters.
So the next thing is to write <tt class="symbol">chooser.jsp</tt>. It should
display something like the figure below.
</p>


<p align="center">
  
  
<img align="center" src="chooser.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 6. The chooser pop-up</b>
</p>


<p>
When the user clicks one of the radio buttons the name and ID of the
chosen topic are written back into the original form and the pop-up is
closed. If the user clicks "Cancel" the form is closed, and nothing
happens. The user can also type a new search and press search if the
right topic doesn't appear in the list. The code to produce this
window is shown below.
</p>


<pre>&lt;tolog:context topicmap="library.xtm"&gt;

&lt;%
  String search = request.getParameter("search");
  String field = request.getParameter("field");
  String form = request.getParameter("form");
%&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Choose author&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action="chooser.jsp" method="get"&gt;
&lt;input type=hidden name=field value="&lt;%= field %&gt;"&gt;
&lt;input type=hidden name=form value="&lt;%= form %&gt;"&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Search
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text name="search" value="&lt;%= search %&gt;"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;input type=submit value="Search"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;%
  if (search != null) {
    String query =
      "value-like($TN, \"" + search + "\"), " +
      "topic-name($AUTHOR, $TN), " +
      "instance-of($AUTHOR, person)?";
%&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;&lt;!--
    function choose(id, name) {
      window.opener.document.forms['&lt;%= form %&gt;']['&lt;%= field %&gt;-name'].value=name;
      window.opener.document.forms['&lt;%= form %&gt;']['&lt;%= field %&gt;-oid'].value=id;
      window.close();
      window.opener.document.forms['&lt;%= form %&gt;'].submit();
    }
  --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;logic:set name="authors"&gt;
    &lt;tm:tolog query="&lt;%= query %&gt;" select="AUTHOR"/&gt;
  &lt;/logic:set&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

         &gt;&lt;tolog:out var="AUTHOR"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;

  &lt;input type=button onclick="window.close()" value="Cancel"&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

&lt;/tolog:context&gt;</pre>



<h3>
<a name="N103C1">3.7. Various tips</a>
</h3>



<p>
If you want to control the order in which actions are executed this is
actually trivial: actions are executed in the order they are found
within the <tt class="symbol">actionGroup</tt> element in the
<tt>actions.xml</tt> file.
</p>






<h2>
<a name="N103D3">4. More advanced subjects</a>
</h2>



<p>
Now that we have walked through the basics of creating a web editor
application it is time to look at some of the more advanced aspects of
building such applications.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N103DB">4.1. Saving changes</a>
</h3>



<p>
When a form is submitted to the server the actions modify the
underlying topic map, and once the entire form has been processed the
changes will either be committed or, if there were errors, rolled
back. This means that either all changes will be committed, or none.
As the developer you do not have to worry about this; the framework
will handle all the details for you.
</p>


<p>
If the topic map is stored in the RDBMS backend the changes will then
be automatically persisted in the database, but if the in-memory
implementation is used only the in-memory objects will change. In this
case it will be necessary to export the topic map to a file in order
to persist the changed topic map.
</p>


<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd>
  
<p>We do <em>not</em> recommend using the in-memory
  implementation with Web Editor applications. Persisting changes by
  saving the topic map to disk at intervals will cause problems if
  users modify the topic map while a save is in progress. Similarly,
  the in-memory implementation does not support transactions, and thus
  editing operations that fail can leave the topic map in an
  inconsistent state.</p>

  
<p>It is possible to use the in-memory implementation for
  development, piloting, and simple proofs-of-concept, however.
  If you really want to do this, despite our warnings, you can use the
  example code below.</p>

  
<pre>
  &lt;%@ page import="net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.*, net.ontopia.topicmaps.entry.*, 
                   net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.*, 
                   net.ontopia.topicmaps.nav2.utils.*"%&gt;&lt;% 
    // look up navigator application
    TopicMapRepositoryIF rep = ContextUtils.getRepository(pageContext.getServletContext());
  
    // retrieve topic map
    TopicMapStoreIF store = rep.createStore("mytopicmap.ltm", true);
    String filename = null;
    try {
      // work out correct path
      filename = pageContext.getServletContext().getRealPath("file.xtm");
  
      // save it to disk 
      ImportExportUtils.getWriter(filename).write(store.getTopicMap());
    } finally {
      store.close();
    }
  %&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
  File successfully saved to &lt;%= filename %&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>

  
<p>
  To use this code, add it as a JSP page to your application (for
  example as <tt>save.jsp</tt>). It must be modified so
  that the topic map ID and the file name are correct for your
  application. The topic map can then be saved by accessing the JSP
  page. This will write an XTM file into the root directory of your
  web application. The code can be modified to write to the Omnigator
  topic maps directory, or the topic maps directory of your
  application, if desired.
  </p>

</dd>
</dl>



<h3>
<a name="N103FC">4.2. Locking</a>
</h3>



<p>
When more than one person uses the editor application it can easily
happen that two different users access the same topic at the same
time, which will cause the changes made by one user overwrite those
made by the other. 
</p>


<p>
In order to avoid this the web editor framework lets you lock a
collection of objects when rendering a form. Typically, this
collection will only contain the topic being modified, but there are
occasions when you may want to lock dependent objects. To do this,
simply use the <tt class="symbol">lock</tt> attribute of the
<tt class="symbol">webed:form</tt> element, as shown below.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Using the lock attribute</b>
</p>


<pre>
&lt;webed:form actiongroup="person" lock="person"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name 
  &lt;webed:field action="set-name" object="name" type="tfs"&gt;
    &lt;tolog:out var="name"/&gt;
  &lt;/webed:field&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;webed:button action="person"        object="person"   text="Change"/&gt;
&lt;webed:button action="delete-person" object="person"   text="Delete"/&gt;
&lt;/webed:form&gt;
</pre>



<p>
This shows the form for editing the name of a 'person' topic modified
to lock the person topic when the page is rendered. This means that
until the form is submitted nobody else can edit this topic. The
<tt class="symbol">lock</tt> attribute must contain the name of a variable,
and all the objects in the collection that variable is bound to will
be locked. Should one of them fail to be locked none will be locked,
and the page will fail to load with an error message.
</p>


<p>
You can control what page the user is to go to next should the locking
fail by adding an element to the corresponding action group. Below is
shown how this is done for the form shown above.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Action group for 'person' topics</b>
</p>


<pre>
  &lt;actionGroup name="person"&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- actions related to form input fields --&gt;
    &lt;action name="set-name" class="ActionSetBasenameValue"/&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- principal actions --&gt;
    &lt;action name="person"        class="DummyAction"/&gt;
    &lt;action name="delete-person" class="ActionDelete"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define forward rules --&gt;
    &lt;forwardRules&gt;
      &lt;forwardDefault path="person.jsp"/&gt;
      &lt;forwardLocked path="locked-person.jsp"/&gt;
      &lt;forwardRule action="delete-person" forward="frontpage"/&gt;
    &lt;/forwardRules&gt;
  &lt;/actionGroup&gt;
</pre>



<p>
If the person topic being edited is locked, this will forward the user
onto the <tt>locked-person.jsp</tt> page.
</p>


<p>
When a form is submitted the locks established by that form will be
released, but it may well be that the user never submits the form. In
this case the lock will expire after a timeout.
</p>


<h4>
<a name="N10434">4.2.1. Clustering</a>
</h4>



<p>When using the RDBMS Backend Connector in a cluster the Web
Editor locks will also have to be clustered, so that locks are being
properly synchronized across the cluster. To do this one can use a
tool called <a href="http://www.terracotta.org/">Open
Terracotta</a>. No code changes are required, but an active
Terracotta server must be running. The JVM(s) running Ontopia must
also be Terracotta-enabled.</p>


<p>To start the Terracotta server, first download and install the
Terracotta software. Then start up the server with the following
command:</p>


<pre>
cd $TERRACOTTA_HOME
sh ./bin/start-tc-server.sh
</pre>


<p>Note that you may want to adjust the Terracotta server
configuration to your needs. You may also want to have additional
passive servers running so that you get failover support.</p>


<p>To make the JVM(s) running the Ontopia Terracotta-enabled a few
system properties need to be passed on to the JVM on startup:</p>


<pre>
-Xbootclasspath/p:${TERRACOTTA_HOME}/lib/dso-boot/dso-boot-hotspot_XX_YYY_ZZ.jar
-Dtc.install-root=${TERRACOTTA_HOME}
-Dtc.config=${ONTOPIA_HOME}/rdbms/clustering/ontopia-terracotta.xml
</pre>


<p>Before you start the JVM make sure that you have created a boot
jar for your specific JVM. The boot jar file can be found in
<tt>${TERRACOTTA_HOME}/lib/dso-boot/</tt>. A new boot jar
can be created with the following command:</p>


<pre>
cd $TERRACOTTA_HOME
sh /bin/make-boot-jar.sh
</pre>


<p>You may also want to make some changes to the default Terracotta
client configuraton file that is shipped with Ontopia:
<tt>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/rdbms/clustering/ontopia-terracotta.xml</tt>.</p>






<h3>
<a name="N10460">4.3. Writing custom actions</a>
</h3>



<p>
If the Web Editor Framework does not contain the action you need to
implement a specific piece of functionality you can always write your
own action and plug it into the system. What you do is to create a
class that implements the
<tt class="interfacename">net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.core.ActionIF</tt>
interface.
</p>


<p>
An action object must have a method implementing the action, and
that's all. This method is what actually performs the action when
matching form data is received.
</p>


<p>
The action will be passed two parameters, one of which implements the
<tt class="interfacename">ActionParametersIF</tt>. Through this object
the parameters passed to the action can be retrieved, as well as any
string values or objects passed by the form element. In addition there
is the <tt class="interfacename">ActionResponseIF</tt>, which can be
used to set request parameters for the forward page.
</p>


<p>
The interaction with transactions means that there are some important
rules that action implementations <em>must</em> follow:
</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>Never call the <tt class="methodname">commit</tt> or
<tt class="methodname">abort</tt> methods on the transaction object from
an action. This will interfere with the transaction handling of the
framework and will have unpredictable consequences.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Do not keep <em>any</em> references to topic map
objects between calls to the <tt class="methodname">perform</tt> method.
Topic map objects are bound to a specific transaction, and the next
time the action is called the action may be executing in a different
transaction. Trying to use objects retrieved from another transaction
could have disastrous consequences.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Make sure your action object is thread-safe. That is, the
<tt class="methodname">perform</tt> method can be called by different
threads and it may be called by one thread before having finished
executing for another. So be very careful with storing state on the
object.
</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>
If something goes wrong within the action the action should throw an
exception. Errors reported by actions generally fall into two
categories:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>Non-critical errors</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>These are generally errors caused by misbehaviour on the
      part of the user (incorrect string values, operation performed
      that was not allowed, etc), which are detected by the action,
      and reported back to the user. Non-critical errors do not
      prevent other actions from running, nor do they cause the
      transaction to be rolled back.</p>
    
</dd>
<dt>Critical errors</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>These are generally caused by bugs or environment failures
      (full disk, database is down, etc). Critical errors prevent
      other actions from running and cause the transaction to be
      rolled back so that the state of the topic map is not
      affected.</p>
    
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
The Web Editor Framework considers only
<tt>ActionRuntimeException</tt>s which do not
have the <tt class="symbol">critical</tt> property set to be non-critical
errors. All exceptions of other classes, as well as those which have
the <tt class="symbol">critical</tt> property set are considered critical.
</p>



<h3>
<a name="sect-assign-player">4.4. Using the AssignRolePlayer action</a>
</h3>



<p>
The first problem people tend to run into when using this action is
that they can't quite work out what the long list of parameters means,
and usually this is because they don't really understand the structure
of associations. This is not so strange, since associations are
actually quite complicated. Even a binary association has eight
different components, as shown in the diagram below.
</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="associations.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 7. The structure of associations</b>
</p>


<p>
This diagram shows an association stating that one task depends on
another, so this is an example of the associations we might be editing
in <a href="#sect-task-dependencies">section
        2.6</a>. The list below explains
each numbered node in the diagram.
</p>


<ol>
<li>
    
<p>This is 'test-x', one of the tasks, which is to
    test software system X. So this is the topic being edited in
    <a href="#sect-task-dependencies">section
        2.6</a>; the current task, if you
    like.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is the role type 'after', which is played by the thing
    that depends on another. (So this association says that 'test-x'
    depends on 'implement-x'.) Note that this is a topic.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is the association type 'depends-on', also a topic.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is the role type 'prior', which is played by the thing
    that something depends on, and it's a topic, too.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is 'implement-x', another task, which is to implement
    software system X. This is the topic that you would select in the
    drop-down list to create (or change) the association.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is an association role, which has the type 'after' and
    is played by the 'test-x' topic.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is the association itself, which has two roles and the
    type 'depends-on'.</p>
  
</li>
<li>
    
<p>This is the other association role, which has the type
    'prior' and is played by the 'implement-x' topic.</p>
  
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Now we can walk through the list of parameters to the action and work
out what each one means.
</p>


<dl>
<dt>association</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>This parameter needs to contain the association itself
      (number 7 above). If it contains an association the action will
      change the topic at the other end of the association (that is,
      it will change number 5 to whatever topic is chosen in the
      list). If it is empty, the action will create a new association
      from scratch. (More on this below.)</p>
    
</dd>
<dt>assoctype</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>This parameter needs to contain the association type,
      which is number 3 in the list above.</p>
    
</dd>
<dt>fixedplayer</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>This is the topic being edited; number 1 in the list.</p>
    
</dd>
<dt>fixedrole</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>This is the type of the role played by the edited topic;
      number 2 in the list.</p>
    
</dd>
<dt>otherrole</dt>
<dd>
      
      
<p>This is the type of the role played by the other topic;
      number 4 in the list.</p>
    
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
In the explanation above, one thing that can be a bit tricky to
understand is how the <tt class="symbol">association</tt> parameter works.
What's the difference between the parameter being empty and not being
empty, and how can you make sure the value is right? Let's return to
the example in <a href="#sect-task-dependencies">section
        2.6</a> and study it
more carefully.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Drop-downs for existing associations</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;!-- produce a list of drop-down lists --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;Depends on
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;tolog:foreach query="select $ASSOC, $OTHER from
                                role-player($R1, %task%), type($R1, after),
                                association-role($ASSOC, $R1), type($ASSOC, depends-on),
                                association-role($ASSOC, $R2), type($R2, prior),
                                role-player($R2, $OTHER)?"&gt;

          &lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
                    params="ASSOC t:depends-on task t:after t:prior"
                    collection="tasks"
                    selected="OTHER"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/tolog:foreach&gt;
</pre>



<p>
What we do here is to query for all <tt class="symbol">depends-on</tt>
associations and produce a drop-down list for each one. So inside the
foreach-loop <tt class="symbol">ASSOC</tt> will always be bound to node
number 7 from the diagram, <tt class="symbol">R1</tt> will be node 6,
<tt class="symbol">R2</tt> node 8, and <tt class="symbol">OTHER</tt> will be node 5.
The <tt class="symbol">task</tt> variable was set outside the loop to the
current topic, which is node 1.
</p>


<p>
This means that the first parameter will always have an association in
it, and so the action will change the topic at the other end of that
association to whatever is chosen in the list. (If nothing is chosen
the association is deleted.) Compare the list of parameters in the
example with the list above, and it should be clear what each one is.
</p>


<p>
Now we've seen how to edit existing associations, but not how to
create new ones. Below is the relevant part of the example from
<a href="#sect-task-dependencies">section
        2.6</a>.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Creating new associations</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;%-- make empty variable --%&gt;
&lt;tolog:set var="empty"/&gt;

&lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
          params="empty t:depends-on task t:after t:prior"
          collection="tasks"/&gt;</pre>



<p>
The difference with the previous example is the first parameter, which
is now set to the <tt class="symbol">empty</tt> variable. The
<tt class="symbol">tolog:set</tt> tag doesn't get a value from anywhere, so
the variable ends up being empty, that is, bound to nothing. If the
user selects a task now, the action will see that there is no
pre-existing association, and create a new one. Since it has the
association type and role types, plus the topic on the near end, in
its parameter list it has enough information to build the association
from scratch.
</p>


<p>
There is one more situation in which this action is often used, and
that is when the topic being edited only can have a single association
of the edited type. Let's say that tasks can have a status (and only
one), which is indicated with an association like this (in LTM):
<pre>has-status(implement-x : task, wait : status)</pre>.
This means the task is waiting for tasks it depends on to be finished.
The example below shows how we would edit this type of association.
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Drop-downs for single associations</b>
</p>


<pre>
&lt;tolog:set var="status-assoc"
           query="select $ASSOC from
                    role-player($R1, %task%), type($R1, task),
                    association-role($ASSOC, $R1), type($ASSOC, has-status),
                    association-role($ASSOC, $R2), type($R2, status),
                    role-player($R2, $OTHER)?"/&gt;

&lt;tolog:set var="status"
           query="has-status(%task% : task, $STATUS : status)?"/&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;Status
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;webed:list action="assign-player"
                    params="status-assoc t:has-status task t:task t:status"
                    collection="statuses"
                    selected="status"/&gt;
</pre>



<p>
The two queries here find the association (node 7) and the current
status (node 5) for us, if the current task have them. If it doesn't,
the <tt class="symbol">status-assoc</tt> and <tt class="symbol">status</tt>
variables will be empty. This means that if we have an association
already the task will change it, and if we don't have an association
already, the task will modify it. (And this, of course, is why the
task can both modify and create associations, since it makes editing
in this situation very much easier than if these were different
actions.)

<h3>
<a name="N105BA">4.5. Using the ProcessServlet log</a>
</h3>



<p>
It can be quite difficult to debug web editor applications, because
you can't see what is happening "behind the curtain" when a form is
submitted and the actions are executed. The best solution to this is
to use log4j logging for your web application, and to enable logging
from the <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt>.
</p>


<p>
To do this, add the following line to your
<tt>log4j.properties</tt> file:
</p>



<pre>
log4j.category.net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.servlets.ProcessServlet=DEBUG
</pre>



<p>
This will make the <tt class="classname">ProcessServlet</tt> write lots of
information to the log every time a form is submitted. For example, if
I go to the page for the topic "Lars Marius Garshol" in the tasked
application, and change the name to "Lars M. Garshol" the log output
will be as shown below.
</p>



<pre>
DEBUG "Param 'person6': '[Change]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Param 'tm': '[tasks.ltm]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Param 'set-name5': '[Lars M. Garshol]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Param 'ag': '[person]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Param 'requestid': '[rid4]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Param 'id': '[larsga]'" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Schema is not available, that might be ok." - ProcessServlet 
</pre>



<p>
This first part of the log just shows all the parameters received by
the servlet, which can be useful to see exactly what is submitted with
the form. The last line is just saying that no schema has been found
for the topic map; you can ignore this.
</p>



<pre>
DEBUG "Working on person6 (&lt;ActionInGroup person net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.DefaultAction@1f5b4d1&gt;)" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "data: [ActionData person with 0 param(s) and 0 sub-action(s)]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Original value was: [null]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Parameter value now: [Change]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Action will be executed" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Working on set-name5 (&lt;ActionInGroup set-name net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.basename.SetValue@a030d6&gt;)" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "data: [ActionData set-name with 2 param(s) and 0 sub-action(s)]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Original value was: [Lars Marius Garshol]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Parameter value now: [Lars M. Garshol]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Action will be executed" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Working on delete-person7 (&lt;ActionInGroup delete-person net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.tmobject.Delete@1e4eb5b&gt;)" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "data: [ActionData delete-person with 1 param(s) and 0 sub-action(s)]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Original value was: [null]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Parameter value now: [null]" - ProcessServlet
</pre>



<p>
In this next section, the servlet is going through all the actions in
this form, and checking for each whether to run it or not. We can see
that the 'person' action (attached to the "Change") button will be
run, because its value has changed. This is logical, since this is the
button that was pressed to submit the page.  The 'set-name' action
will also run, because the name was changed, but the 'delete-person'
action will <em>not</em> run, since the value hasn't
changed.
</p>



<pre>
DEBUG "Changes made, since net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.basename.SetValue@a030d6 will run" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "User &lt;unknown&gt; entered transaction phase" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Invoking action [ActionParameters: ], &lt;ActionInGroup set-name net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.basename.SetValue@a030d6&gt;" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Invoking action [ActionParameters: ], &lt;ActionInGroup person net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.actions.DefaultAction@1f5b4d1&gt;" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "No forward page found; getting default" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Transaction committed" - ProcessServlet
DEBUG "User &lt;unknown&gt; left transaction phase" - ProcessServlet 
</pre>



<p>
First, the servlet notes that at least one action has run, so actions
that had <tt class="symbol">runIfNoChanges</tt> set to <tt class="symbol">false</tt>
should also run. Then we get to the transaction phase, where the
servlet goes through each action to be executed and executes it. Then
it notes that no action has set the forward page, so it picks the
default. Then it commits the transaction. (In the in-memory version
the commit step doesn't do anything.)
</p>



<pre>
DEBUG "Forward page is: [ActionForwardPage: relativeURL=person.jsp, framename=, nextActionTemplate=, paramRule=net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.basic.IdentityParamRule@d5cabc, reqParams={}]" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Initial forward URL: person.jsp?&amp;tm=tasks.ltm&amp;ag=person&amp;id=larsga" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "Applying param rule: net.ontopia.topicmaps.webed.impl.basic.IdentityParamRule@d5cabc" - ProcessServlet 
DEBUG "URL after rules applied: person.jsp?&amp;tm=tasks.ltm&amp;ag=person&amp;id=larsga" - ProcessServlet 
INFO  "forward to person.jsp?&amp;tm=tasks.ltm&amp;ag=person&amp;id=larsga" - ProcessServlet 
</pre>



<p>
Finally, the servlet works out where to forward to. It's picked the
default rule for this action group, and that gives it the URL shown.
No interesting param rules are attached, so that becomes the final
URL.
