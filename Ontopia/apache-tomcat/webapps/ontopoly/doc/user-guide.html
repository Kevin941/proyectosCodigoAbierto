<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This is the user guide for Ontopia&rsquo;s self-configuring, ontology-driven
Topic Maps editor, Ontopoly. A topic map consists of both an ontology
and an instance of that ontology; with Ontopoly, you can edit each of these.
The ontology defines the rules for what can go into the instance, and
these rules are used by Ontopoly to automatically generate the interface
for creating and maintaining the instance. This document provides guidance
for creating both ontologies and instances.</p>


<p>Reading this document assumes some basic knowledge about Topic
Maps. If you are not familiar with Topic Maps, try reading one of the
simple introductions, such as <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html">The TAO of
Topic Maps</a>, available from the Ontopia web site. If you are
technically minded, you might also want to look at the <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/">XTM Specification</a> or
the new version of ISO 13250, especially the <a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/">Data
Model</a>.</p>


<p> We welcome any suggestions you might have on ways of improving
this User Guide. Please send them to
<a href="mailto:dev@ontopia.net">dev@ontopia.net</a>.</p>


<p>We hope you enjoy using Ontopoly!</p>

<h2>
<a name="N1004B">1. Getting started</a>
</h2>



<p>Ontopoly is built as a client/server application. As a client, you
use your web browser, while the server is a web server bundled with the
distribution. The server-side application is built using the
Navigator Framework and Web
Editor Framework, which are parts of the
Ontopia Knowledge Suite&trade;. Ontopoly is
accessible within Ontopia, an application that provides easy access to
Ontopoly, Omnigator, and
Vizigator.</p>


<p align="center">

</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 1. Ontopia Home Page</b>
</p>


<p>To install and start up Ontopia, please see
<tt>install.html</tt>. Once you have accessed Ontopia, choose
Ontopoly from the available options.</p>



<h2>
<a name="gen-concepts">2. General concepts</a>
</h2>



<h3>
<a name="overview">2.1. Application architecture</a>
</h3>



<p>Ontopoly&rsquo;s primary purpose is to enable the manual creation and
maintenance of topic maps that may be based on a variety of ontologies.
In order to be able to provide the most intuitive possible user
interface for such a generic application, Ontopoly is
<em>ontology-driven</em>. What this means is that the
forms-based interface for creating and maintaining a topic map is
generated automatically from the underlying ontology and the rules that
are defined for it.</p>


<p>For this reason, you need to create an ontology before you can
edit a topic map instance in Ontopoly. Often the tasks of creating the
ontology and editing the topic map instance (that is, populating the
ontology) will be carried out by different people. Ontopoly is therefore
divided into two main parts: the ontology editor and the instance
editor. The application also has an administration interface, i.e., a
page for adding metadata to the topic map (description, creator,
version, etc.), validating it, etc.; and an interface for exporting to
various interchange syntaxes.</p>


<p>The Topic Map Index Page allows you to open an existing topic map, create
a new one, or import one from outside Ontopoly. Once you have selected one
of these actions, you are taken to the application pages. The overall
architecture and the navigation paths between the various parts of the
application are shown in <a href="#int-ovr">figure 2</a>.</p>


<p align="center">

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 2. Overview of Ontopoly&rsquo;s architecture</b>
</p>



<h3>
<a name="components">2.2. Configuring and populating topic maps</a>
</h3>



<p>Ontopoly&rsquo;s two primary functions provide a comprehensive Topic Maps
editing environment.</p>


<ol>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Configuring a topic map</strong>: ontology
and schema creation</p>

<p>Ontopoly&rsquo;s Type Configuration Pages are used by the ontology
designer to define the topic, name, association, association role, and
occurrence types that will be available to creators of the instance
topics. To take an example, when an author creates a topic of type
<em>composer</em>, the Instance Editing Page will show the
fields that apply to a <em>composer</em>, such as name, date
of birth, and works; but when editing an <em>opera</em>, the
fields will be different.</p>

<p>As the ontology designer assigns fields (such as associations and
occurrences) to a topic type, the designer is also creating the schema.
The creation of the ontology and the schema are seamless and appear to
the designer as a cohesive operation. For further detail on ontology
creation, see <a href="#OE">section
        3</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Populating a topic map</strong>: instance
creation</p>

<p>Once an ontology is created, it can be used to guide populating
the topic map. The Instance Editing Pages are used by the person
authoring the topic map instance. The available topic types are provided
from the ontology. The schema constraints give the instance author
further support by allowing only specific association types and
occurrence types to be used with an instance of a given topic type. For
further detail on instance editing, see <a href="#IE">section
        4</a>.</p>

</li>
</ol>




<h3>
<a name="N100FC">2.3. User interface conventions</a>
</h3>



<p>Ontopoly has a web-based interface. For a discussion of the various
areas of the Ontopoly interface and a complete list of icons, tabs and
buttons used in the interface, please see <a href="#appA">Appendix
A</a>.</p>



<h3>
<a name="start-page">2.4. Topic Map Index Page</a>
</h3>



<p>Before you can create either the ontology or the instance, you
have to open a topic map, so let&rsquo;s start there.</p>


<p>When you first access Ontopoly from Ontopia, you are taken to the
Topic Map Index Page, see <a href="#wel-pg-fig">figure 3</a>. On the left, is a column
for <strong>Ontopoly Topic Maps</strong>, in the middle is the list
of <strong>Other Topic Maps</strong> (also referred to as
&ldquo;non-Ontopoly topic maps&rdquo;), and on the right is the area for
creating new topic maps. Another column, <strong>Missing Topic
Maps</strong>, will also appear on this page if an Ontopoly topic map has
been deleted from outside Ontopoly. For more information on deleting Ontopoly
topic maps, please see <a href="#del-tm">section
        3.8.1</a>.</p>


<p align="center">
<a name="wel-pg-fig">

<img align="center" src="images/doc_welcome_page.png" width="75%">
</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 3. Ontopoly Topic Map Index Page</b>
</p>


<p>Ontopoly imports topic maps in the XTM 1.0 and 2.0, CTM, LTM, and
TM/XML syntaxes; it will also import RDF. By default Ontopoly creates
topic maps as XTM files in the Omnigator&rsquo;s
<tt>topicmaps/</tt> directory. For information on
exporting from Ontopoly, see <a href="#export">section
        3.9</a>.</p>


<h4>
<a name="open-topicmap">2.4.1. Ontopoly topic maps</a>
</h4>



<p>A topic map created in Ontopoly (an <dfn>Ontopoly topic
map</dfn>) will differ from one created outside of it (a
<dfn>non-Ontopoly topic map</dfn>). An Ontopoly topic map carries
along with it topics that let it interact with the Ontopoly application and
topics that define the schema (the <dfn>system
topics</dfn>). You can always export a topic map from Ontopoly to
remove the system topics, but they are needed for the topic map to be
understood within the application. (It&rsquo;s the system topics that
make it possible for Ontopoly to automatically configure its instance
editor for maximum ease of use.) Similarly, pre-existing non-Ontopoly topic
maps will need these system topics to be added. Ontopoly automatically adds
them when opening a non-Ontopoly topic map.</p>


<p>In the situation where you are trying to load an Ontopoly topic
map using an older versjon of the ontology, you will be forward to an
upgrade page. If you want to perform the upgrade click the
<strong>OK</strong> button. Otherwise click
<strong>Cancel</strong>. Once the upgrade is done you will be
forwarded to the Type Type Index Page.</p>


<p align="center">
<a name="open-topicmap-upgrade">

<img align="center" src="images/open-topicmap-upgrade.png" width="75%">
</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 4. Conversion page</b>
</p>




<h4>
<a name="open-non-topicmap">2.4.2. Opening a non-Ontopoly topic map</a>
</h4>



<p>If you try to open a non-Ontopoly topic map, you will be forwarded
to the conversion page, which looks something like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<a name="open-topicmap-convert">

<img align="center" src="images/open-topicmap-convert.png" width="75%">
</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 5. Conversion page</b>
</p>


<p>Opening a non-Ontopoly topic map converts it to an Ontopoly topic map
and creates an index in the process (which may take several minutes).
When you click on a non-Ontopoly topic map, you will get information
about the conversion process. If the topic map contains features not
supported by Ontopoly (see <a href="#appB">appendix
        B</a>), you will see a
warning and a list of the unsupported features that are used in the
topic map. There are options to update your existing topic map or
create a copy of it. After this decision, you are taken to the Topic
Type Configuration Page.</p>


<p>During the conversion, Ontopoly makes decisions about the ontology,
based on what it finds in the topic map, and generates the strictest
possible schema. Sometimes it will be stricter than necessary. For
example, if occurrences of a particular type (say,
<em>email</em>) never occur more than once for any
<em>person</em> topic, then Ontopoly may create a rule allowing
a maximum of one <em>email</em> occurrence per
<em>person</em> topic. You may want to relax the rule,
however, using Ontopoly&rsquo;s ontology editor, in order to allow for the
possibility of multiple <em>email</em> occurrences in the
future. For this reason you should always examine the ontology generated
by Ontopoly when importing an external topic map, and adjust it to reflect
the true intent behind the topic map.</p>




<h4>
<a name="N101EA">2.4.3. Creating a new Ontopoly topic map</a>
</h4>



<p>Use the <em>Name</em> field in the right hand column of
the page to create a new topic map. After naming the topic map, you are
taken to the Topic Type Configuration Page. The name you enter will be
used for the name of the topic map and will appear in the left-hand
column on the Topic Map Index Page when subsequently accessed. (You will be able to change it later, if you
like, see <a href="#topic-map-config">section
        3.8</a>.) The name will also be
used to generate a file name, with the extension
<tt>.xtm</tt> being added automatically.</p>







<h3>
<a name="N10202">2.5. Our example topic map</a>
</h3>



<p>A simple topic map example will be used throughout the next two
sections to illustrate Ontopoly&rsquo;s functionality. It is a topic map
that captures information about artists, the albums they have made, and
tracks on the album. We've called it <cite>Jill&rsquo;s
Music</cite> and it&rsquo;s based on an ontology called
<cite>MyMusic</cite>; both are included in the Ontopoly
distribution.</p>


<p>So, why wait? Go on now to section <a href="#OE">section
        3</a> and start
creating your first topic map in Ontopoly!</p>




<h2>
<a name="OE">3. Using the Type Configuration Pages</a>
</h2>




<p>Each topic map you create will be about some domain of knowledge,
such as your corporate intranet, medical research, recording artists,
the works of Shakespeare, etc. A topic map identifies subjects and the
relationships between those subjects. Each of the subjects will be of a
certain type, e.g., Puccini and Verdi are composers, La Scala and Fenice
are opera houses, Milan and Venice are cities, etc.</p>


<p>Using Ontopoly&rsquo;s Type Configuration Pages, you will create the
<dfn>typing topics</dfn> that will control your topic map: topic,
association, occurrence, role and name types. You will also create the rules
for how the typing topics are used together.</p>


<p>To provide a practical introduction to Ontopoly&rsquo;s
functionality, we&rsquo;ve created an ontology for a music organization
topic map, <cite>MyMusic</cite>, and an example topic map that
uses that ontology, <cite>Jill&rsquo;s Music</cite>.</p>


<p>Here are the topic types we will be working with:</p>


<blockquote>

<pre>Album
Artist
   Group
   Individual Artist
Track</pre>

</blockquote>


<p>The indentation indicates that Group and Individual Artist are subtypes
(or subclasses) of Artist.</p>


<p>In addition, we have defined the following association
types:</p>


<blockquote>

<pre>Album created by
Belongs to album
Is a Member of</pre>

</blockquote>


<h3>
<a name="onto-indexes">3.1. Type Index Pages</a>
</h3>



<p>When you open an existing or newly created topic map, you are
taken to the Topic Type Index Page, see <a href="#tt1">figure 6</a>. Here
you&rsquo;ll see menu buttons for each kind of typing topic: topic
types, occurrence types, association types, role types, and name types.
The <strong>Ontology</strong> tab is available on every
page in Ontopoly. Clicking on it will always bring you to the Topic Type
Index Page. From there you can quickly access the corresponding Type
Index Pages for other kinds of typing topics, which are typically used
less often.</p>


<p>All of the Type Index Pages are more-or-less the same. Each one
presents a tree of existing types and a field for creating a new type.
The types are displayed as a type hierarchy and includes buttons for
expanding and collapsing the tree structure.</p>


<p>Clicking on any of the typing topics (or creating a new one) takes
you to the appropriate Configuration Page, as described below.</p>


<p align="center">

</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 6. Topic Type Index Page</b>
</p>


<p>Creating an ontology is an iterative process. Through
Ontopoly&rsquo;s interface, you can navigate easily between the Type Index
Pages and the Type Configuration Pages. In the following we describe
each kind of Type Configuration Page in turn, but in your work you will
find yourself moving back and forth throughout the process.</p>



<h3>
<a name="config-pages">3.2. Type Configuration Pages</a>
</h3>


<p>There are five kinds of types in Topic Maps: topic types,
occurrence types, association types, role types, and name types. Each
of these has its own kind of Type Configuration Page, which is
accessed via the links at the top on the Type Index Pages. Each Type
Configuration Page is unique, but some fields are common to all of
them (see <a href="#tt-config-1">figure 7</a>):</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: Editable name of the typing
topic.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Subject identifier</strong>: The (Published) Subject
Identifier of the typing topic. Its value must be a URI. The
<img align="center" src="images/expand_all.gif" title="Add field"> icon following this field indicates that you can create
more than one. A subject identifier is not required, but is good
practice. For more information on using PSIs, please see the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/3050/pubsubj-pt1-1.02-cs.pdf">OASIS
Recommendations</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Description</strong>: Field for defining and
documenting the topic type. We recommend that you use this field
extensively to capture your intentions regarding the role of this type
in your ontology.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>The following two fields appear on the Advanced view panel for
all types:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Read-only</strong>: You may create typing topics that
can only be read. The instance author will be able to choose such a
topic type and read what is in it, but no instances may be
created.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Hidden</strong>: In some cases topic types should only
be seen by the ontology designer, and that&rsquo;s the perfect use of
this choice as the topic will not be available in the instance
editor.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>The following sections provide more detail on each kind of Type
Configuration Page.</p>



<h3>
<a name="create-tt">3.3. Configuring topic types</a>
</h3>


<p>The Topic Type Index is shown in <a href="#tt1">figure 6</a>. From here
you can enter a name for a new topic type in the field and then click
<strong>Create</strong>, or you can choose an existing topic type
to view or edit. Our example already contains an ontology which has been
partially populated, so we will go straight to the Topic Type
Configuration Page for a pre-existing type,
<em>Artist</em>.</p>


<h4>
<a name="tt-config-page">3.3.1. Topic Type Configuration Page</a>
</h4>


<p>Configuration pages control what the instance authors will see as
they create topics of a given type. Let&rsquo;s look at the Topic Type
Configuration Page in <a href="#tt-config-1">figure 7</a>. </p>


<p>The main portion of the page is divided into three parts: the
top part lists the core properties of the typing topic (its name,
subject identifier and description fields plus abstract, superclass
and subclass fields which are specific to topic types); the lower part
of the page lists those properties, or &ldquo;fields&rdquo; (i.e.,
names, identifiers, occurrences, and associations), that will apply to
instances of the type; the right part contains operations, that can be
performed on the topic type, and links to other relevant pages.</p>


<p>The properties that are common to all typing topics and thus
occur on all Configuration Pages were described above in <a href="#config-pages">section
        3.2</a>. This applies to <strong>Name</strong>,
<strong>Subject identifier</strong>,
<strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Read-only</strong>, and
<strong>Hidden</strong>. The first three fields are shown in the
Default view panel and the last two on the Advanced view panel. The
following additional properties are specific to topic types:</p>



<h4>
<a name="tt-config-standard-default">3.3.2. Properties of the typing topic (Default view panel)</a>
</h4>

</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 7. Topic Type Configuration Page - default properties</b>
</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: Check this box if you
want to use this typing topic as a model for other topics, but don't
want a user to create any instances of it directly. Typically, an
abstract topic will be a supertype in a hierarchy of topics. In our
example, we have a two-tier hierarchy where <em>Artist</em> is
the supertype and <em>Individual Artist</em> and
<em>Group</em> are subtypes. We will not want authors to
create instances of <em>Artist</em>, only of its subtypes.
However, having the <em>Artist</em> supertype is useful
because, once we define it, its subtypes will inherit all of its fields.
If one subtype requires fields not needed by the other subtypes, those
fields can be added at subtype level.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Superclass</strong>: A drop down list of topics from
which to choose a supertype (i.e., a parent in the type hierarchy) for
the current topic. (In our example there is no supertype, because
<em>Artist</em> is at the top of the hierarchy and thus has no
parent.)</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Subclass</strong>: A list of topics of which
this topic is the supertype (i.e., parent in the type hierarchy). In our
example, although <em>Artist</em> has no supertype, it does
have two subtypes, each of which is highlighted as a link that can take
you to the corresponding Type Configuration Page. After the last
subtype, there is a <img align="center" src="images/create.gif" title="Create"> icon that can be used to create another
topic type which will automatically become a subtype of the current
topic type.</p>


<p>Note that the type hierarchy can be constructed from two
directions: upwards (by assigning the supertype of each topic type), or

<strong>Large instance set</strong>: Some topic types have
such a large set of instances that you do not want the user to be able
to display the entire list, because this would take too long to

Ontopoly turn off the listing feature, and would require the user to

<strong>Hierarchical associations</strong>: Here you can

be selected here are those which on the Association Type Configuration
Page (see <a href="#at-config-page">section
        3.5.1</a>) are defined as being
hierarchical. The effect of this setting is to get topics of this type
presented in a tree view on the Instance Index Page (see <a href="#inst-index">section

<p>
<strong>Hierarchy definition query</strong>: Sometimes you
will want to define your own hierarchy for the instances of a topic
type without using the default hierarchy pattern. For those situations
you can specify a tolog query that retrieves the preferred
hierarchy. The query should return two columns, which contains all the
parent/child combinations in the hierarchy/tree. The first column must
contain the parents and the second column must contain the
children. Topics with no parents and no children must return null in
the parent column and itself in the child column. The query should
also sort first by the parent column and then by the child column. The
query can take one parameter, <tt class="parameter">%topicType%</tt>,
which is the topic type itself. There are no restrictions on the
column names. <span class="remark">[<b>Remark: </b>This is not yet supported.]</span>

<p>Next is the field label. The label is a link that lets you

<p>To the right of the field label is the value type of the
field. This will tell you what kind of values can be assigned to this
field. In our example the <em>Name</em> is a name string,
the <em>Subject identifier</em> is a URI, and the
<em>Description</em> is a string. The association fields
shows the kind of topics that can be associated through the field. The
<em>Contains track</em> can contain
<em>Track</em>s and the <em>Album created

type is <em>Many</em> then multiple topic types can be
associated through that field. Hold the mouse over the
<em>Many</em> label to see which topic types that
is.</p>


<p>The drop-down list shows the cardinality choices for the number
of times the field can or must be used in the Instance Editing

<p>Each line ends with the <img align="center" src="images/remove.gif" title="Remove field"> icon, which is used to
remove fields, i.e. unassign them. Removing a field will make it once
more available as a option to reassign. If the icon is shown
instead of the remove icon then it means that the field has been
assigned to a supertype. Clicking the icon will navigate to the
supertype that declares the field. The field can then be removed there
instead.</p>


<p>We now know how to add fields to a topic type. However, most of

<p>Most associations are binary, that is, there are two role
players, such as in parent-child or employer-employee
relationships. You can also create associations with only one role
player, or with three or more role players. We will focus on binary
associations for the scope of this document.</p>


<p>Binary associations are bi-directional. For example, an association
named <em>composed-by</em> might sound like it is only
uni-directional, i.e., Tosca is composed by Puccini. However, it also
represents the relationship expressed as, for example, Puccini composed
Tosca. Topic Maps accomplishes this bi-directionality, unambiguously, by
assigning roles to the players. The relationship expressed in
<a href="#assoc-bidirectional">figure 19</a> can be described as, &ldquo;In the
composed-by relationship, the role of composer is played by Puccini and
the role of work is played by Tosca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Association Type Configuration Page contains one new
checkbox in the top portion of the form,
<strong>Symmetric</strong>, and an association field labelled
<strong>Association field</strong>.</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Symmetric</strong>: A symmetric relation is one
which is the same from both (or all) directions. The teacher/pupil
relation is not symmetric, because the two participants are doing
different things, whereas the is-neighbour relation is symmetric,
since there&rsquo;s no difference between the two neighbours. In one
sense, you can say the participants in a symmetric relationship are
equal, which does not hold for created-by, killed-by, eaten-by, but
does hold for works-with, is-a-friend-of, is-a-sibling-of,
is-the-spouse-of, etc.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Association field</strong>: This is the relation
between the association type and its association fields. Inside each
association field, of which there is normally only one, there is
another field called <strong>Roles</strong> that references the
individual role fields. The role field box represents the field that
is assigned to topic types. The actual topic types that is assigned
the field (and indirectly the role type and association type) can be
seen in the Used by field. In our example the association type has one
association field which has two role fields.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<h5>
<a name="assoc-config-roles">3.5.2.1. Roles</a>
</h5>



<p>In general, there is one role box for each role player. In most
cases, there will be two role players and therefore two role boxes. In
symmetric associations (and unary associations), there is only one role
box. It is also possible to have more than two role players (in what are
known as &ldquo;n-ary associations&rdquo;); an example of a ternary
association (one with three role players) would be a perpetrator, a
victim, and a cause of death in a "killed / killed-by"
association.</p>


<p>Each role box has four fields:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: You can define a string as the label
that will be seen from the perspective of this role. For example, in a
parent-child relationship, from the perspective of the parent role, the
label might be "is the parent of", while from the perspective of the
child role, the label would be "is the child of".</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Role type</strong>: The values available in the drop-down
correlate to role type topics. You can create new role types directly
from this page by using the <img align="center" src="images/create.gif" title="Create"> icon, which will take you to a new
Role Type Configuration Page, see <a href="#role-types">section
        3.6</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Used by</strong>: Use the drop-down list to
choose the appropriate topic type to play this role. Note that this is a
repeatable field as multiple topic types may play the same role. New
topic types can be created directly from this page using the <img align="center" src="images/create.gif" title="Create">
icon. Once you choose <strong>Confirm</strong>, the drop-down box is
replaced by a link to the chosen topic type. The <img align="center" src="images/expand_all.gif" title="Add field"> icon
generates another drop-down box for additional choices.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Cardinality</strong>: The field specifies the
cardinality of the field. The cardinality specifies the number of
times the field can or must be used in the Instance Editing
Page. There are four possible choices: <em>Exactly
one</em>, <em>One or more</em>, <em>Zero or
more</em>, and <em>Zero or one</em>. The default is
<em>Zero or more</em>.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Interface control</strong>: Choose between providing
instance authors with a drop-down list of valid topic types, or a search
box, or a browse window, or an auto-complete input field.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you have created an association type, visit the Topic Type
Configuration Pages of the topics that play roles to make sure the
cardinality for the use of the association is correct. These should be
reviewed from the perspective of each role player as they may differ,
e.g., a student goes to one school (<em>Exactly one</em>), but
a school may have many students (<em>One or more</em>).</p>

<p>
This section allows you to configure an association type as being
hierarchical. To do this, you must also set the role types correctly,
so that Ontopoly knows which role is the parent role and which is the
child role. The purpose of this to enable Ontopoly to show you the
hierarchy formed by these associations. 
</p>


<p>
An example might be the hierarchy formed by the geographical
"contained in" association. The parent role here would be "container"
and the child role would be "containee". Setting this up would allow
you to browse your collection of geographic places as a tree on the
Instance Index Page (see <a href="#inst-index">section
        4.1.1</a>) and in the
Topic Selection Dialog (see <a href="#topic-select-dialog">section
        4.1.4</a>).
Another example might be the broader/narrower relationship from
taxonomies and thesauri, which you can find in the UK Government
Category List, which comes with Ontopoly.
</p>


<p>Note that to register an association type as hierarchical one
must add the <em>Hierarchical Relation Type</em> topic
type to the association type. At the moment this can only be done in
Administrator mode, and using the <strong>Add or remove topic
type</strong> action item on the right side of the page.

</ul>





<h3>
<a name="role-types">3.6. Configuring role types</a>
</h3>



<p>Role types are used in associations to represent the semantics
of why a topic participates in an association. For role types one
either selects an existing topic type (e.g. "opera") or one creates a
topic that represents a more specific role (e.g. "composer"),
i.e. something that describes what it means for a topic to be part of
the role. As you can see one might choose a role type that represents
what the player does as opposed to what the person inherently
is. Beethoven is a person, but he is also composer because he composed
something. Topic types should be universally valid for the topic. Role
types on the other hand can, and often should, be more context
dependent. Role types should be as generic as possible so that they
can easily be reused across association types. For example, whether
you have a "composer/opera", "author/book", or "artist/painting"
association, the roles the topics play in all three of these examples
might be "creator" and "creation", even though the association types
could be different.</p>


<p>You can create new role types or choose one for edit from the
Role Type Index page, see <a href="#rt1">figure 22</a>, which will take you
to the Role Type Configuration Page, see <a href="#role-config-page-1">figure 23</a>. </p>

<p>Name types are used to define the names of topics in various
contexts. Frequently used name types include <strong>nickname</strong> and <strong>short</strong>, but one of the most popular uses is to
provide the name of the topic in multiple languages. You can create new
name types or choose one for edit from the Name Type Index, see <a href="#nt1">figure 25</a>, which will take you to the Name Type Configuration

removes the file from the disk.</p>


<dl>
<dt class="note">Note</dt>
<dd>

<p>Ontopoly keeps track of your Ontopoly topic maps. Manually deleting an
Ontopoly topic map from the file system (as opposed to using the
<strong>Delete</strong> button on the Description Page) will
result in the display of a <strong>Missing Topic Maps</strong>
column on the Topic Map Index Page. Therefore, it is best practice only to
delete Ontopoly topic maps through the <strong>Delete</strong> button
on the <strong>Description</strong> tab.</p>

</dd>
</dl>


<p>Clicking the <strong>Delete</strong> button will open up a
confirmation window. Choose <strong>OK</strong> to delete the
topic map. You will then be taken to the start page (see <a href="#appB">appendix

<h4>
<a name="enabling-shortcuts">3.8.2. Enabling shortcuts</a>
</h4>



<p>The <strong>Enable shortcuts</strong> action item on
right-hand side of the Description Page (<a href="#config">figure 28</a>)
will enable some useful shortcuts in the user interface. The field
labels in the editing pages will become links. The <img align="center" src="images/goto-details.gif" title="Edit field details"> icon
will let you go directly to the topic that represents the
field. Clicking the field label will navigate to the name type,
occurrence type, association type or identity type topics declared by
the field. You can later disable shortcuts by clicking the button
again.</p>


<p>Here is an example of what an editing page looks like with
shortcuts enabled:</p>

<h4>
<a name="ontology-annotation">3.8.3. Ontology annotation</a>
</h4>



<p>
The <strong>Enable ontology annotation</strong> action item on
right-hand side of the Description Page (<a href="#config">figure 28</a>)
turns on ontology annotation, which is a very powerful feature, but
one that can be a little confusing at first. The basic idea is that
the normal Ontopoly (without this feature) allows you to say anything
you want about instance topics, but for typing topics you are pretty
much restricted to names, subject identifiers, and the description
field. This may not sound like much of a problem, but there are a lot
of useful things that can be done if you can annotate your ontology
topics.
</p>


<p>
Generally, ontology annotation enables you to build more dynamic
applications, by moving logic out of your code and into the topic
map. To take a trivial example, imagine building a search page for
your topic map. On this page you'll need to display things like "found
X people", "found Y documents", etc, and to do this you need to
display the plural names of the topic types. You can of course do this
with a big multi-way test (if current topic type is "person", display
"people"). But the easiest way is to make a name type "Plural name"
and to give each topic type such a name.
</p>


<p>
With ontology annotation this is easy. Once you turn ontology
annotation on, the topic types "Topic type", "Association type", etc
show up in the list of topic types. This lets you give them fields in
the same way as normal topic types, and you can edit them in the
normal way.
</p>


<p>This what the Topic Types Index Page looks like with annotation
enabled. The ontology types are displayed in italic.</p>

<h4>
<a name="administration-mode">3.8.4. Administration mode</a>

<p>
The <strong>Enable administration mode</strong> action item on
right-hand side of the Description Page (<a href="#config">figure 28</a>)
turns on admistration mode, which is an extremely powerful feature as
it gives you access to everything in the topic map, including the
Ontopoly model itself.
</p>


<dl>
<dt class="warning">Warning</dt>

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 33. Export Page</b>
</p>


<p>You can choose to export the topic map with or without the system
topics (those topics that make up the constraints or rules for using the
ontology). In general, other downstream applications such as browsers
will neither understand nor need the schema topics. The export is done
to a browser window and can be saved from there.</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10918">3.10. Saving a topic map</a>
</h3>



<p>Any modifications made in an editing page will be sent to the
server immediately and written into the topic map. The application is
AJAX based, so modification are sent to the server as soon as they are
made. If an error occurs, the user may be redirected to a page showing
the errors instead of the intended destination.</p>


<p>The back button will work in the way it generally does on the
web, and will return to the previous page or to the previous state of
the current page. Note that previous page may be slightly out of date
if any changes were made to the topic since it was displayed the first
time.</p>


<dl>
<dt class="warning">Important</dt>
<dd>

<p>Changes to your topic map are <em>not</em>
automatically persisted to disk on the server unless you are using
Ontopoly with the relational database backend of the Ontopia Knowledge
Suite. With the free version of Ontopoly, which operates in-memory, it is
necessary to press the <strong>Save</strong> button in order to
save the topic map to disk: pressing the
<strong>Confirm</strong> does <em>not</em> save to
disk; it merely submits the current page and updates the topic map
<em>in memory</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="IE">4. Using Instance Editing Pages</a>
</h2>



<p>The Instance Editing Pages are used to create instance topics
conforming to the ontology and constraints developed using the Type
Configuration Pages.</p>


<h3>
<a name="inst-indexes">4.1. Topic Type Index Page</a>
</h3>



<p>When you choose the <strong>Instances</strong> tab, you will
land at the instance index of all topic types. If your ontology includes
a type hierarchy, you will be able to show the complete tree by clicking
on <strong>Expand all nodes</strong>, with the result as shown in
<a href="#inst-topic-types-index">figure 34</a>. Topic types that are allowed
to have instances are shown as links.</p>

<p>From this index, you can choose a topic type to see a list of

<h4>
<a name="instance-page">4.1.2. Instance Editing Page</a>

<p>The Instance Editing Page is used to edit individual instance
topics, and is the most central page in Ontopoly, since most editing will
happen here. The contents on the page are entirely determined by the
ontology and schema for the topic type (see <a href="#tt-config-page">section
        3.3.1</a> for more on the Topic Type Configuration
Page). All the allowable fields for a topic type are available on the
Instance Editing Page, along with the allowable values for those
fields.</p>

<p>When editing a topic there may be validation errors. These

values for a given field. The error messages shows up right above the
individual field. The topic map can be saved while there are
validation errors.</p>

<h4>
<a name="N109AD">4.1.3. Changing a topic&rsquo;s type</a>
</h4>



<p>Frequently, it is easier to create a new instance from another
instance, rather than going back to the Instance Index Page. However
the next instance to be created might be of a different type than the
current one. In such cases, the instance author can use the
<strong>Change the topic type</strong> choice in the
Action Items Panel immediately upon accessing the new Instance Editing
Page, picking the new type from the drop-down box.</p>


<p>There are other times when changing the topic type will be useful.
For example, in an employee database, employees might be typed by their
status, such as probationary, tenured, retired, etc. As their status
changes, their topic type might change as well.</p>


<p>Changing a topic&rsquo;s type can lead to a number of knock-on
effects that require action. For illustration purposes in <a href="#change-type">figure 38</a>, the <em>Individual Artist</em>
type topic <em>Sir Paul McCartney</em> has been changed to
an <em>Album</em> type topic. Now a new set of fields will
be displayed for the topic. Some of the fields are the same:
<em>Name</em>, <em>Subject identifier</em> and
<em>Description</em>, while <em>Contains
track</em> and <em>Album created by</em> replaces
<em>Nickname</em>, <em>Is/was a Member of</em>
and <em>Created album</em>. The user interface now
complains that information is missing in the <em>Contains
track</em>. Note that the information from the old fields are
still stored on the topic, but the fields are not presented in the
user interface. Changing the topic type back to <em>Individual
artist</em> will again show the original fields with the
original values.</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 38. Messages when changing a topic&rsquo;s type</b>

<h4>
<a name="topic-select-dialog">4.1.4. Assigning topics to associations</a>
</h4>



<p>You can create new topics by clicking the <img align="center" src="images/create.gif" title="Create"> icon. If
there are multiple topic types that can participate in the
association, then you will be presented with a context menu, like the
one below, where you can select the topic type of the new
instance.</p>

<a name="association-create-player-context-menu">

<img align="center" src="images/association-create-player-context-menu.png" width="75%">
</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 39. Create player context menu</b>
</p>


<p>A new instance will then be created and associated to the
current topic. A popup window will then open and let you edit some
basic information about the new instance. Close the popup by clicking
the <strong>OK</strong> button or the <strong>X</strong> in
the top right corner.</p>

<img align="center" src="images/association-create-player.png" width="75%">
</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 40. Create player popup window</b>
</p>


<p>
By default topics at the other end of associations are selected using
drop-down boxes, but this can be changed in the configuration of the
association type in the <strong>Interface control</strong>
field. The alternative for interface control are: <strong>Drop-down
list</strong>, <strong>Search dialog</strong>, <strong>Browse
dialog</strong>, and <strong>Auto-complete</strong>.</p>


<p>This is what the default drop-down list looks like. You may have
to press <img align="center" src="images/add.gif" title="Add new value"> before it shows up.</p>

<b>Figure 41. A drop-down list</b>
</p>


<p>The interface controls <strong>Search dialog</strong> and
<strong>Browse dialog</strong> use a popup dialog where the user
can either search for the topic to associate with, or browse for it.</p>


<p>If we change the example topic map so that to select an album
created by an artist you have to use the dialog, the instance editing
page from <a href="#inst-topic">figure 36</a> would have a little search
button instead of the drop-down box.</p>

case by clicking "Browse". This is also the dialog you would get if
the interface control had been <strong>Browse dialog</strong>.
</p>


<p>
Note that it's possible to control what shows on the browse screen by
configuring the topic type. It's possible to make the topics be shown
in a hierarchy, or to make it impossible to display the list of topics
(because the list is too big). See <a href="#tt-config-standard-advanced">section

<p>Although Ontopoly ships in a single-user configuration, there is
support for multiple users under the hood. This support consists
of:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>Support for storing the topic map in a relational database using
the RDBMS backend. This enables Ontopoly to scale to much larger topic
maps, avoids having to explicitly save the topic map, and ensures that
multiple users can work against the same topic map without causing data
to become corrupt. To make use of this support the OKS Enterprise
Edition is required.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Support for concurrent editing. This support is always enabled in
all Ontopoly versions, and ensures through locking that two different
users cannot edit the same topic at the same time.</p>
