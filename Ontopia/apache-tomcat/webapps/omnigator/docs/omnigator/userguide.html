<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This document is the user's guide to the Ontopia Omnigator, the
omnivorous topic map navigator built using Ontopia. It explains how to
navigate topic maps using the Omnigator, and also provides some
guidance on how to create and load your own topic maps. It assumes
some basic knowledge about topic maps.  We welcome any suggestions you
might have on ways of improving this User Guide. Please send them to
<a href="mailto:dev@ontopia.net">dev@ontopia.net</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="N10027">1. Introduction</a>
</h2>



<p>The Omnigator is an application that lets you load and browse
any topic map, including your own, using a standard web browser. The
name is a contraction of "omnivorous navigator", and was chosen to
underline the application's principal design goal, which is to be able
to make sense of <em>any</em> conforming topic map. The
Omnigator is intended as a teaching aid, to help you understand topic
map concepts, and as an aid in developing your own topic maps.</p>


<h3>
<a name="N10032">1.1. A word about the user interface</a>
</h3>



<p>Before going any further it needs to be made clear that the
Omnigator&rsquo;s user interface is not to be recommended for an
end-user application. End-users shouldn&rsquo;t need to know that the
application they are using is driven by a topic map. They don&rsquo;t
need to understand concepts like &ldquo;topic&rdquo;, &ldquo;topic
type&rdquo;, &ldquo;association&rdquo;, and &ldquo;scope&rdquo;, and
they shouldn&rsquo;t even be exposed to such terms. The user should
simply experience a user interface that for once makes it possible to
really find the information they are looking for, quickly, easily, and
intuitively.</p>


<p>So why have we chosen not to hide the underlying machinery in
the user interface of the Omnigator? Precisely because it is intended
as a teaching aid targeted at authors, knowledge workers,
documentalists, and developers, who want to understand more about
Topic Maps and perhaps create (and debug) their own topic maps. So
don&rsquo;t be surprised by the &ldquo;jargon&rdquo; terms you will come across: They
are there for a purpose. Think instead about how the real-world
applications you will build can hide the technicalities while at the
same time harnessing the power of Topic Maps to provide an even more
exhilarating experience for your end users! The <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/solutions/navigator.html">Ontopia
Navigator Framework</a> (part of Ontopia) is the toolkit you need
for building that kind of application. The Omnigator is just a generic
browser implemented using the Navigator Framework. (For examples of other,
jargon-free interfaces see the <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/operamap/">OperaMap</a>,<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/i18n/">Scripts and Languages</a>, and
<a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/xmltools/">Free XML Tools</a>
applica&shy;tions.)</p>




<h3>
<a name="N1004E">1.2. About this user guide</a>
</h3>



<p>This guide starts with a brief tour of one of the topic maps
included in the Omnigator distribution, explaining the various aspects
of the user interface and the information it provides. It that assumes
you have some basic knowledge about topic maps. If you don&rsquo;t,
try reading one of the simple introductions, such as <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html">The TAO of
Topic Maps</a>, available from the Ontopia web site, or the
chapter "Topic Maps: Knowledge navigation aids" in the
<a href="http://www.xmlbooks.com/xhb.htm">XML Handbook</a>. If
you are technically minded you might also want to look at the <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0">XTM Specification</a>, the
original <a href="http://www.y12.doe.gov/sgml/sc34/document/0129.pdf">ISO 13250
standard</a>, or the new version of ISO 13250, especially the
<a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/">Data
Model</a> and the <a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-xtm/">XTM 2.0
syntax</a>.</p>


<p>Following the Guided Tour we discuss some of the more
sophisticated aspects of the Omnigator. Finally, for those that have
never created their own topic map, we offer a short tutorial to prove
just how easy it is to get up and running with your very first topic map
in the Omnigator!</p>


<p>If you want to know how the Omnigator works, a brief description
follows. If you&rsquo;re not interested, go straight to the next
section.</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10078">1.3. How the Omnigator works</a>
</h3>



<p>The Omnigator uses a simple client-server architecture based on a
standard http protocol.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/omnigator.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 1. The Omnigator Architecture</b>
</p>


<p>On the server side there is a J2EE web application built using
Ontopia, that runs in the Tomcat web server. This application reads
(and writes) topic maps and generates HTML pages on the fly. On the
client, a standard web browser receives these HTML pages and displays
a view of some portion of the topic map. This view is rich in links,
built from the data structures that constitute the topic map. Each
time the user clicks on a link, a request is sent to the server
application, resulting in a new set of information extracted from the
topic map.</p>


<p>If you have a standard installation of the free Omnigator
download, the Tomcat server will be running on the same machine as the
client. Alternatively, your local technical support team may have
installed the server on another machine. If you are using our online
demo, the server is on the Ontopia web site. But whatever the
configuration, the view from the client side will be pretty much the
same.</p>








<h2>
<a name="N10094">2. The Guided Tour</a>
</h2>



<p>This section assumes that you have a correctly configured
installation of the Omnigator with the server up and running, or that you
are using the online demo. (For installation and start-up information, see
the installation guide that accompanies your distribution.)</p>


<h3>
<a name="N1009C">2.1. The Welcome Page</a>
</h3>



<p>To begin this demonstration start your web browser and point it at
one of the following URLs:</p>


<dl>
<dt>Local installation</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/omnigator/">http://localhost:8080/omnigator/</a>
</dd>
<dt>Online demo</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/omnigator/">http://www.ontopia.net/omnigator/</a>
</dd>
<dt>Custom installation</dt>
<dd>
<em>Contact your local technical support team for
details.</em>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>You should now see the <dfn>Welcome Page</dfn>, saying
&ldquo;Welcome to the Omnigator&rdquo;. If you have difficulty getting
to this starting point, then please refer to the install documentation,
contact your local technical support team, or contact the Ontopia
support team at <a href="mailto:support@ontopia.net">support@ontopia.net</a>.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/WelcomePage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 2. The Welcome Page</b>
</p>


<p>On the Welcome Page there is a list of topic maps that are available
to the application. (You will find out how to add one of your own in
<a href="#manage-page">section
        3.2</a> of this User Guide). The Welcome Page also
contains a number of useful links to provide you with short cuts to
topic map information and examples.</p>


<p>This demonstration uses Steve Pepper&rsquo;s <em>Italian
Opera Topic Map</em>, a fairly small but semantically rich topic
map that has been used in many talks and tutorials in the last few
years.</p>


<p>You can return to the Welcome Page from anywhere in the
application by clicking on the <strong>Open...</strong> button in
the top right-hand corner.</p>



<h3>
<a name="tm-page">2.2. The Index Page</a>
</h3>



<p>To go to the <tt>opera.ltm</tt> topic map,
click on it in the list of topic maps, which is on the left hand side of
the Welcome Page. A new page opens, shown in the figure below. We call
this page the <dfn>Index Page</dfn>. At the top you will see
a row of buttons. The <strong>Welcome</strong> button
takes you back to the Welcome Page. The other buttons are generated by
<dfn>plug-ins</dfn>, which are discussed in <a href="#plug-ins">section
        3.6</a>.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/TopicMapPage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 3. The Index Page for the Italian Opera Topic Map</b>
</p>


<p>The purpose of the Index Page is to provide you with various
overviews of the topic map as a whole. The views can be chosen from the
list of links on the left, as follows:</p>


<dl>
<dt>Ontology</dt>
<dd>The ontology view shows the "types", or
&ldquo;kinds of things&rdquo; that exist in the topic map. It does so
by providing alphabetical lists of topic types, association types,
association role types, and occurrence types. All of these types are
also topics; clicking on any one of them causes it to become the
current topic, but more about that in a moment. Note that the
Omnigator&rsquo;s notion of what constitutes a typing topic is
entirely empirical: For example, if (and only if) a topic has
instances that are themselves topics, then it is regarded as a topic
type, regardless of what the author&rsquo;s intention might have
been.</dd>
<dt>Master Index</dt>
<dd>The master index view counts and lists all the topics in the topic
map, in alphabetical order, under the heading <strong>Index of Topics</strong>.</dd>
<dt>Index of Individuals</dt>
<dd>This view lists all topics <em>except</em> typing
topics.</dd>
<dt>Index of Themes</dt>
<dd>The themes view lists all topics that are used as themes in the
topic map. (Themes are topics that are used to defined scope and are
therefore sometimes called scoping topics.) The themes are grouped
according to the kinds of topic characteristics (names, variant names,
occurrences, and associations) they are used to scope.</dd>
<dt>Unnamed Topics</dt>
<dd>This link only appears if the topic map contains topics that have
no base name. Clicking on it results in a list of such topics labelled
either by their XML ID (if they have one; topics from merged topic maps
do not) or by their internal object ID, and followed by their type (if
any). This list is useful for debugging since the absence of a base name
often indicates an error in the topic map.</dd>
<dt>Hierarchies</dt>
<dd>Under this heading a list of hierarchical association types is
displayed (if any are present in the topic map). These are association
types that conform to Techquila&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.techquila.com/psi/hierarchy/#hierarchical-relation-type">hierarchical
relationship design pattern</a>. Clicking on one of these links
results in a tree view of that particular hierarchy. (One reason for
introducing this feature was because people were abusing the
supertype-subtype relationship in order to get the Omnigator to display
other kinds of hierarchical relationships using indentation. With the
new generalized tree widget, this should no longer be necessary.)</dd>
</dl>


<p>In the screen shot above, the name of the topic map is displayed
at the top of the page. If the topic map does not have a name, the
Omnigator simply displays the words &ldquo;Index Page&rdquo;. (In order
to give a topic map a name it must be <em>reified</em>, as
described in <a href="#reification">section
        4.8</a>.)</p>


<p>If metadata has been assigned to the topic map (using the
mechanism described in <a href="#metadata">section
        4.9</a>), it will be displayed
in a box headed <strong>Topic Map Metadata</strong> on the left-hand
side of the screen.</p>


<p>To open another topic map, use the <strong>Open...</strong>
button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.</p>


<p>If you use an application other than Ontopia&rsquo;s new
ontology-driven editor, Ontopoly, to modify a topic map that is already
loaded, you will need to reload it in order to see the effects of your
changes. This is easily done via the <strong>Reload</strong>
button in the top right-hand corner. After reloading the topic map, the
Omnigator attempts to return you to the topic page you were on; if this
is not possible (because the topic map no longer contains a topic with
the same XML ID), you will be returned to the topic map&rsquo;s Index
Page. (NOTE: If the topic map is full-text indexed (see <a href="#fulltext">section
        3.6.8</a>), it will be automatically reindexed when you
reload it. If the topic map is large this might take some time.)</p>



<h3>
<a name="N10197">2.3. The Topic Page (of a topic type)</a>
</h3>



<p>Having investigated the index views and hopefully gained some idea
of what the topic map itself is all about, go to the ontology view and
click on the topic 'Composer'. A new page opens, shown in the diagram
below. We call this page the <dfn>Topic Page</dfn> and
'Composer' is the <dfn>current topic</dfn>.</p>


<p>Note that a new button appears on the button bar, to the right of
the <strong>Welcome</strong> button, containing either
the name of the topic map (in its short form, if it has one, which it
does in our example), or the text <strong>Index Page</strong>. Clicking on this button
will always bring you back to the topic map&rsquo;s Index Page. (To learn how
to specify a short name for a topic map, see <a href="#reification">section
        4.8</a>.)</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/TopicPage-composer.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 4. The Topic Page for topic type 'Composer'</b>
</p>


<p>The Topic Page presents the information held in the topic map
about the current topic, in this case the information about the topic
'Composer'.</p>


<p>The <em>kind</em> of information presented will depend
on the nature of the current topic. The main title will always be the
most appropriate name of the topic, based on the type(s) of the topic
and the <em>current context</em> (described in <a href="#set-context-page">section
        3.6.2</a>). In addition, all the base names (and any
variant names) of this topic will be shown, along with the themes that
define their scopes (unless context-based filtering is in effect). In
the illustration we see that the topic 'Composer' has seven names: one
in the unconstrained scope, and six others in language scopes
corresponding to French, Italian, Czech, Finnish, Hungarian, Dutch,
German, and Norwegian.</p>


<p>Names that have no type are grouped together under the heading
<strong>Untyped Names</strong>, as in the example above. Typed
names, on the other hand, are grouped separately and the name type is
used as a heading. In the example in the next section, the composer
Puccini has two untyped names (one of them scoped), and also a name of
type <strong>Normal form</strong>, &ldquo;Giacomo Puccini&rdquo;.
(NOTE: Typed names were introduced with the revised 2006 version of the
Topic Maps standard. Topic maps written using XTM 1.0 will only have
untyped names.)</p>


<p>Under <strong>Associations</strong> we find the topics that
'Composer' is associated with. The topic 'Composer' doesn&rsquo;t
participate in any associations, apart from subclassing associations.
The association section is therefore empty, except for the association
to its supertype ('Musician'). For other kinds of topics we would
typically see more associations (as the screenshots to follow will
show).</p>


<p>Because 'Composer' is a <dfn>topic type</dfn> (i.e., a
topic that defines a class of topics), we also get a list of topics of
this type, in other words, an Index of Composers. If the current topic
is an <dfn>association role type</dfn> (i.e., a topic that
defines a class of roles played in associations), the Omnigator displays
a similar list with the heading <strong>Players of this
Role</strong> (see the topic 'Person' for an example of this).</p>


<p>Sometimes the same topic is used for both purposes, i.e., to type
other topics and to type association roles. The topic 'Composer' is a
case in point: It also defines one of the role types in 'Composed by'
associations. In cases like this, the Omnigator will display
<em>two</em> lists of topics (one entitled <strong>Topics
of this Type</strong>, the other entitled <strong>Players of this
Role</strong>) <em>unless</em> the two lists are identical
(as they are in the case of 'Composer'), in which case only the first
list is displayed. (<strong>TIP:</strong> When the
Omnigator displays two such lists and their contents are very similar,
it often indicates an inconsistency in your topic map.)</p>


<p>Finally, under <strong>Subject Identifiers</strong> are listed
URIs for each <dfn>subject identifier</dfn> that this topic
has been given. In this case there is just one. Sometimes there are none
and there may also be more than one. Subject identifiers are a mechanism
for establishing which subject a topic represents; they are the basis
for performing topic map merging without the problems normally caused by
homonyms and synonyms. If the author of the topic map has followed
<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/tmp/pubsubj-gentle-intro.htm">OASIS'
recommendations</a> for Published Subjects, clicking on a subject
identifier should lead to a resource called a <dfn>subject
indicator</dfn> that provides a human-interpretable
&ldquo;indication&rdquo; of the identity of the subject represented by
the current topic.</p>


<p>If the current topic represents an information resource and has a
<dfn>subject locator</dfn>, this will be shown in addition
to any subject identifiers.</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1020F">2.4. The Topic Page (of an individual topic)</a>
</h3>



<p>All the themes, types, topic instances, and role players on a
Topic Page are also topics. You can click on any one of them, and it
then becomes the current topic. Try this by clicking on the topic
'Puccini'. The result is a new Topic Page, shown below, with Puccini as
the current topic.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/TopicPage-Puccini.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 5. The Topic Page for topic 'Puccini'</b>
</p>


<p>'Puccini' is a different kind of topic than 'Composer'. Whereas
'Composer' is a topic type (and association role type), 'Puccini' is an
individual, and therefore the kind of information that is presented is
slightly different. We still have the principal name and a complete list
of names. We also have a section for <strong>Associations</strong>, but this time the
contents are rather more extensive. We also see several new headings,
explained below.</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Types</strong> simply lists the types (or
classes) of which 'Puccini' is an instance, in this case,
Composer.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>Internal Occurrences</strong> displays
occurrences of the topic 'Puccini' that are internal to the topic map,
in this case, the composer&rsquo;s dates of birth and death.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
<strong>External Occurrences</strong> displays
occurrences that are resources external to the topic map.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>Occurrences are organized by type, the name of the type being
displayed in bold as a heading. Note that occurrences are displayed in
different ways, depending on whether the occurrences are internal or
external to the topic map. With internal resources (encoded using
<tt>&lt;resourceData&gt;</tt> elements in XTM syntax), the
contents of the resource are shown inline. With external resources
(encoded using <tt>&lt;resourceRef&gt;</tt> elements in XTM
syntax), only the locator of the resource is shown, unless there is a
topic that represents the resource, in which case the resource&rsquo;s name is
displayed instead (along with a small icon). (To learn how to name a
resource in this way, see <a href="#using-PSIs">section
        4.6</a>.) Clicking on the
locator (or the icon) makes your browser go to the resource. Clicking on
the name takes you to the topic page for that resource (from which you
can access the resource itself via its subject locator).</p>


<p>The section headed <strong>Associations</strong>, lists topics that are related
with the current topic through associations, grouped according to the
type of the association. It is the equivalent of &ldquo;see also&rsquo;s&rdquo; in a
back-of-book index (except that here there is an association type that
tells us something about the <em>nature</em> of the &ldquo;see
also&rdquo; relationship). For 'Puccini' we have associations labelled 'Born
in', 'Composed', 'Died in', 'Exponent of', and 'Pupil of'. Under each of
these labels are the associated topics. We see that Puccini was born in
Lucca, that he composed a number of operas, including <em>La
Boh&egrave;me</em>, <em>Tosca</em>, and
<em>Turandot</em>, that he died in Brussels, was an exponent
of the musical style known as verismo, and that he was a pupil of
Ponchielli.</p>


<p>When displaying names of associated topics, the Omnigator assumes
a current context defined by the current topic. Thus the name of La
Boh&egrave;me is given as &ldquo;La Boh&egrave;me&rdquo; even though its name in the unconstrained
scope (in order to distinguish it from Leoncavallo&rsquo;s opera of the same
name) is actually &ldquo;La Boh&egrave;me (Puccini)&rdquo;. The section headed <strong>Scoped
Names</strong> at the bottom of the page lists topics whose names are scoped by
the current topic. (If any occurrences were scoped by this topic, they
would be listed in a separate section labelled <strong>Scoped Occurrences</strong>;
similarly, if any associations were scoped by the current topic their
types would be listed in a separate section labelled <strong>Scoped Association
Types</strong>. See the topics 'Italian' and 'Biography' for more
examples.)</p>


<p>If you move the cursor over the associated topics (for example
'Lucca'), you&rsquo;ll see the text &ldquo;Role type: Place&rdquo; appear as a pop-up (or
however your browser displays element titles). This tells you that
'Lucca' plays the role of 'Place' in the 'Born in' association. If the
association is scoped, the names of the topics comprising the scope will
also be displayed.</p>


<p>All of the associations in which Puccini plays a role are binary,
i.e., they involve exactly two topics (Puccini and one other). However,
associations can have any arity: They may be n-ary (i.e., involve three
or more topics) or even unary (involving just one topic). You will see
how the Omnigator displays n-ary associations shortly. Unary
associations are less usual, but some topic map authors use them to
represent boolean properties, such as 'Unfinished'. Unary associations
are displayed separately from other associations, as you will see if you
click on 'Turandot'.</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10273">2.5. Cruising the Knowledge Web</a>
</h3>



<p>Click now on 'Lucca'. A new topic page opens, and Lucca is the
current topic. It is a topic of type 'City', located in Italy, and the
birthplace of both Puccini and Catalani. The association with Puccini is
the same as the one we just used to get to this page, it is simply
labelled differently. This illustrates an important point about topic
maps: There is no directionality in associations, just different roles
played by the participants, thus giving a structure which can be
navigated in any direction required by an application. (To find out how
to label your association types differently in different contexts, see
<a href="#adding-associations">section
        4.7</a> in the tutorial.)</p>


<p>Now click on 'Catalani'. He becomes the current topic. We see that
he too was a composer of operas, born in Lucca (well, we already knew
that: that&rsquo;s how we found him), and that he died in Milan.</p>


<p>Click on 'Milan'. Milan is an interesting city: Not many people
were born there, but lots of people died there! Why? Well, if you know
anything about Italian opera, you know that Milan is the home of the
opera house La Scala and thus the &ldquo;Mecca&rdquo; of Italian opera. A composer
may not have happened to be born in Milan, but if he was any good he
would tend to gravitate there during his career, and that would increase
the chance of him dying there! (This, by the way, is an interesting
example of the kind of new insights revealed by the juxtaposition of
information found in a topic map. The author of this topic map did not
set out to illustrate Milan&rsquo;s position as the Mecca of Italian opera;
that fact was &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; by the characteristics that collectively
constitute the topic 'Milan'.)</p>


<p>Click now on 'Teatro alla Scala', and you will see a list of all
the operas that were first performed there. (See, it must have been an
important place!) Choose 'Madame Butterfly'. You see the premi&egrave;re date,
the name of its most famous aria, the play on which it was based, its
principal characters, who the composer was (our old friend, Puccini),
etc.</p>


<p>Click now on 'Cio-cio-san' for an example of how the Omnigator
displays n-ary associations. Two ternary associations are shown under
the headings 'Killed by' and 'Kills (by)'. These are actually the same
association type, but since Cio-cio-san plays different roles in them
they are presented separately and labelled differently. In fact they are
actually the same association (the one representing Cio-cio-san&rsquo;s
suicide, in which she plays the role of both victim and perpetrator!).
Note how the fact that one topic plays multiple roles in a single
association is emphasized through the use of the label <strong>[self]</strong>.</p>


<p>Now retrace your tracks to 'Madame Butterfly'. What you have
essentially been doing is wandering around a semantic network, or
knowledge web, about Italian opera. Hopefully you are learning a lot
about that domain in the process, even without visiting any of the
information resources themselves. To delve deeper into a particular
topic of interest, simply follow a link to one of the resources. For
Madame Butterfly they include two synopses, the libretto, and
more.</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10291">2.6. The Topic Page (of an occurrence type)</a>
</h3>



<p>So far we have only looked at topics that type other topics and
association roles ('Composer'), and topics that are individuals
('Puccini', 'Lucca', 'Catalani', 'Milan', 'La Scala', 'Madame
Butterfly', 'Cio-cio-san'). Now let&rsquo;s look at a topic that is an
occurrence type. Under <strong>External Occurrences</strong> find
one of the occurrences that is of type 'Synopsis' and click on the link
in bold text; 'Synopsis' becomes the current topic. The information
shown for a topic that types occurrences is of a different kind: What
you see now is (on the left) a list of topics that have occurrences of
this type, and (on the right) the addresses of all those
occurrences.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/TopicPage-synopsis.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 6. The Topic Page for occurrence type 'Synopsis'</b>
</p>


<p>To see another example of an occurrence type topic, click on
'Aida' (at the top of the list of occurrences), and then on 'Premi&egrave;re
date' (under <strong>Internal Occurrences</strong>). The result is
an alphabetically ordered list of every topic that has a premi&egrave;re date,
and a chronological list of all the corresponding dates. This time the
<em>contents</em> of the occurrences are shown rather than
the addresses, because all the occurrences are internal rather than
external.</p>

<h3>
<a name="N102BA">2.7. The Topic Page (of an association type)</a>
</h3>



<p>Now go back to Tosca (first performed in 1900) and from there to
the character Floria Tosca (under 'Dramatis personae'). Note the
associations of type 'Killed by' and 'Kills (by)'. Floria Tosca is also
involved in two such associations, one of them in two different roles
(because she too kills herself). Click on the heading 'Killed by'. The
topic 'Killed by', which types these associations, becomes the current
topic. The information shown for a topic that types associations is
different yet again: This time we see all topics that play roles in
associations of this type, grouped according to the role they play. (The
association type 'Killed by', as we have seen, is not binary; it can
(and usually does) have more than two roles. In this case they are
'Cause of death', 'Perpetrator', and 'Victim'. In the case of suicides,
both the latter roles are played by the same character.)</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 8. The Topic Page for association type 'Killed by'</b>
</p>


<p>On this gory note, we used to end our guided tour of the basic
Omnigator interface. But there is another way to view your topic maps:
Using the Vizigator.</p>




<h3>
<a name="vizigator">2.8. The Gentle Art of Vizigation</a>
</h3>



<p>Hit the Back button a couple of times and you should be back at
the topic 'Tosca' (the opera, not the character). Click on the <strong>Vizigate</strong> button, wait a few seconds while the
applet loads, and you should get a graphic display like the one shown
below:</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/Viz-tosca-1.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 9. Vizigating 'Tosca' (locality = 1)</b>
</p>


<p>What you see is the focus topic ('Tosca') and all directly related
topics, i.e., characters (e.g. Mario, Scarpia, Floria Tosca, etc.),
arias (Vissi d&rsquo;arte, etc.), the composer Puccini, the setting (Rome),
the librettists (Illica and Giacosa), and the play on which the opera
was based (La Tosca). Topics are shown as labelled nodes and
associations as arcs. Shapes and colours denote different topic types
and association types. Mousing over an arc displays the name of the
association type (e.g. &ldquo;composed by&rdquo; for the blue arc connecting Tosca
and Puccini).</p>


<p>You can zoom in and out by using the <dfn>Zoom
bar</dfn> at the top of the screen and you can move the whole
graph around, either by using the scroll bars on the right and at the
bottom, or by dragging the background. Topic nodes can also be dragged
to different positions. (The Vizigator does have a mind of its own and
will want to have a say in how nodes are distributed. If you insist on
deciding exactly where a topic node should be positioned, right click on
it and select <strong>Sticky</strong>.)</p>


<p>The Vizigator chooses a name in a special scope (whose PSI is
<tt class="symbol">http://​psi.ontopia.net/​basename/​#short-name</tt>),
if there is one. Otherwise it chooses a name in the unconstrained scope.
(There should always be one of these if your topic map follows good
modelling practice.) Failing that a scoped name is chosen at random. If
the name is too long, it is abbreviated; in that case, mousing over the
topic will show the full name.</p>


<p>Other names, types, identifiers, and occurrences can be viewed by
right-clicking on the topic and selecting <strong>Properties</strong>. You can navigate directly to any
external occurrences displayed in this box by first marking them (single
click) and then right-clicking and selecting <strong>Go to...</strong>.</p>


<p>Topic nodes can be added and removed from the display in a number
of ways:</p>


<ol>
<li>

<p>By increasing or decreasing the <dfn>Locality
factor</dfn> using the increment/decrement number control to the
left of the Zoom bar. This can take a couple of seconds, so be patient.
You will quickly discover that topic maps of any size rapidly become
very &ldquo;busy&rdquo; and you will have to zoom out to get a full overview, or
zoom in to see details.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>By clicking on a topic node that has a little red box in the top
right-hand corner. This tells you that the topic has additional
associations that are not displayed. Clicking on the topic brings those
new associations into view.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>By right clicking on a topic node and selecting either <strong>Expand node</strong>, <strong>Collapse node</strong>, or <strong>Hide node</strong>.
Expanding has the same effect as clicking on the node; collapsing has
the effect of hiding all associated topics that are not associated with
some other topic; hiding speaks for itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/Viz-tosca-2.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 10. Zooming in on 'Tosca' at locality = 2</b>
</p>


<p>Other options on the Context Menu reached by right-clicking on a
topic node are: <strong>Set as Start Topic</strong>,
which refocuses the graph on that topic, and <strong>Go to Topic Page</strong>, which takes you to the Topic Page for that topic
in the normal Omnigator interface.</p>


<p>The Vizigate plug-in will work with any topic map, including your
own. However, most of the topic maps that are bundled with the Omnigator
use predefined configurations created using the VizDesktop, which is
part of Ontopia. The VizDesktop provides an interface for defining
shapes, colours and fonts, and for designating which topic types and
association types should be filtered out of the display in order to
make the visualization more manageable.</p>


<p>The VizDesktop also allows you to configure whether or not
association role types are displayed. For the Italian Opera Topic Map it
was decided not to display the role types since these can mostly be
inferred quite easily. The default setting however, and the one you will
see in your own topic map, is for role types to be displayed along with
association types.</p>


<p>Our introductory tour of the Omnigator is now finished. The
following section describes some of the more sophisticated aspects of
the application, including the Manage Page, the Customize Page, the
Plug-ins, and the support for RDF. Thereafter follows a tutorial on
creating your first topic map.</p>








<h2>
<a name="N10344">3. Advanced Omnigator Topics</a>
</h2>



<h3>
<a name="rdf-support">3.1. RDF support in the Omnigator</a>
</h3>



<p>The Omnigator allows you to load an RDF model and browse it as
though it were a topic map, and to export it in XTM syntax. You can also
export a topic map as an RDF model and even merge topic maps and RDF
models. This new functionality constitutes an important step towards
full interoperability between RDF and Topic Maps and signals the start
of the Omnigator&rsquo;s evolution into a general Semantic Web agent.</p>


<p>The theoretical foundation for this implementation of Topic
Maps/RDF interoperability is to be found in Lars Marius Garshol&rsquo;s paper
<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tmrdf.html">Living with
Topic Maps and RDF</a>. The basic tenet of this approach is that
generic mappings make no sense because Topic Maps and RDF operate at
different levels of semantics. In order to know how best to represent an
RDF model conforming to a particular schema or ontology as a topic map,
it is necessary to specify what kind of topic map construct each
individual predicate should be mapped to. To illustrate this, consider
the following example, taken from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/">RDF Primer</a>:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>RDF example</b>
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:contact="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#"&gt;
  &lt;contact:Person
    rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me"&gt;
    &lt;contact:fullName&gt;Eric Miller&lt;/contact:fullName&gt;
    &lt;contact:mailbox rdf:resource="mailto:em@w3.org"/&gt;
    &lt;contact:personalTitle&gt;Dr.&lt;/contact:personalTitle&gt;
  &lt;/contact:Person&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>
</code>



<p>This example contains three predicates (in the &ldquo;contact&rdquo;
namespace): fullName, mailbox, and personalTitle. (Note that Person is a
type, not a predicate.) The first of these should be mapped to a base
name, the second and third to occurrences. Ontopia has defined an <a href="http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/">RDF vocabulary</a> for
expressing such mappings. For the example above, the mappings would look
as follows:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Example RDF-to-TM mapping</b>
</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;rdf:Description
  rdf:about=
    ="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName"&gt;
  &lt;rtm:maps-to
    rdf:resource="http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/#basename"/&gt;
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;rdf:Description
  rdf:about=
    ="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox"&gt;
  &lt;rtm:maps-to

&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;rdf:Description

  &lt;rtm:maps-to
    rdf:resource="http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/#occurrence"/&gt;
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;</pre>
</code>



<p>Including these three statements (and an additional namespace
declaration) with the original RDF provides the Omnigator with enough
information to be able to interpret the RDF as a topic map. Adding a
little more schema information and a couple of additional mappings
yields an even better result:</p>

<p>An alternative to including the mapping information in the RDF
document is to put it in a separate mapping file. The RDF2TM
plug-in uses this approach and provides an easy interface for
configuring mappings, as described in <a href="#rdf2tm-plug-in">section
        3.6.5</a>.</p>


<p>To learn more about the Omnigator&rsquo;s RDF support, please refer to
the papers and documentation mentioned above. For a more extensive
mapping example, see the file <tt>concert.rdf</tt>, based on
Masahide Kanzaki&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/music">Music
Vocabulary</a> and included in the Omnigator distribution by kind
permission of the author.</p>




<h3>
<a name="manage-page">3.2. The Manage Page</a>
</h3>



<p>The <dfn>Manage Page</dfn> is used to control
various aspects of the Omnigator&rsquo;s configuration, and to load,
reload, and drop topic maps. (Note: The Manage Page is not accessible
in the online demo, and may also have been disabled by your system
administrator.) The functionality available via this page is described
in detail in the Ontopia Navigator Framework Developer Guide. Users of
the Omnigator will primarily be interested in two Manage Page
functions: controlling which topic maps are loaded and controlling
which plug-ins are activated. (The configuration files mentioned in
this section are found in the
<tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/​webapps/​omnigator/​WEB-INF/​config/</tt>
directory.)</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/ManagePage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 11. The Manage Page</b>
</p>


<p>Under the heading <strong>Registry Items</strong> the page
presents a complete list of all the topic maps known to the system,
based on the paths, extensions, and other information provided in the
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file. (This file, and all other
configuration files for the Omnigator, is described in the Navigator
Framework Configuration guide.) The default is to recognise all files
with the extensions <tt>.xtm</tt>,
<tt>.hytm</tt>, <tt>.ltm</tt>, or
<tt>.rdf</tt> in the <tt>{Ontopia}/topicmaps/</tt>
directory. (LTM is the Linear Topic Map Notation, a compact clear-text
syntax for topic maps, defined by Ontopia and useful for rapid
prototyping. An example LTM file is included in the distribution of the
Omnigator. Documentation is included in the distribution and can also be
found at <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html">http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html</a>.
The Omnigator&rsquo;s support for RDF is described in <a href="#rdf-support">section
        3.1</a>.)</p>


<p>Some of these topic maps (those listed in the
<tt>application.xml</tt> configuration file) are loaded
automatically. Others can be loaded manually by clicking on the
<strong>Load</strong> button. Once loaded, the name of the topic
map document is shown in a larger font, and the
<strong>Load</strong> button changes to
<strong>Drop</strong> and <strong>Reload</strong> buttons.
Clicking on the name of a loaded topic map takes you straight to its
Index Page.</p>


<p>If the topic map document is not well-formed, or contains errors,
it will not load. In such a case you will need to fix the errors and
then try again. Some typical errors are:</p>


<dl>
<dt>Well-formedness error</dt>
<dd>The error message will tell you which line the error occurred on.
You may have misspelt (or omitted) a start-tag or end-tag.</dd>
<dt>Validity error</dt>
<dd>If validation of XTM files has been turned on in your
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file you will get errors if your
XTM file is not valid according to the XTM 1.0 DTD. These will be
displayed in the same way as the well-formedness errors.</dd>
<dt>Character encoding error</dt>
<dd>You have used a character that is not legal in the character
encoding the XML parser thinks you are using. This tends to happen when
using one of the ISO 8859-x character encodings without declaring them
in the XML declaration, since the parser will then assume that you are
using the Unicode encoding UTF-8. The error message will suggest that an
XML encoding declaration may be missing.</dd>
<dt>Namespace error</dt>
<dd>If you get the error message &ldquo;No topic maps in document&rdquo;
you have either made a mistake in the namespace declaration (see
<a href="#step2">section
        4.2</a> for what it should look like), or you do not
have a <tt>&lt;topicMap&gt;</tt> element in your document.</dd>
</dl>


<p>The <strong>Refresh Sources</strong> button is
used to refresh the list of topic maps available to the system without
restarting the application. This is useful if you have just added a new
topic map (perhaps your own!) to the <tt>{Ontopia}/topicmaps/</tt>
directory.</p>



<h3>
<a name="plugin-page">3.3. The Plug-in Page</a>
</h3>



<p>The other part of the Manage Page that you might want to
experiment with is the Plug-ins section. Plug-ins are modules that can
be added to Navigator applications to provide additional
functionality.  (Some of those that are shipped with the Omnigator are
described in <a href="#plug-ins">section
        3.6</a>.) Clicking the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> link at the top brings up the
<dfn>Plug-ins Page</dfn>, which lists the names and
descriptions of all the currently installed plug-ins and allows you to
switch them on or off according to your needs. You can also control
which plug-ins are to appear on which pages in the Omnigator.</p>


<p>Please note that any changes you make here will not be saved,
and so the Omnigator will revert to the original settings when you
restart it. To make your changes persistent you should change the
configuration files of the plug-ins. (See
<a href="plugins.html"><cite>The Ontopia Navigator Plug-ins:
Developer&rsquo;s Guide</cite></a> for more information.)</p>



<h3>
<a name="fulltext-admin">3.4. The Full-text Indexing Plug-in</a>
</h3>



<p>Next to the link to the Plug-ins section at the top of the Manage
page is a link to the <em>Full-text indexing page</em>. This
page allows you to create full-text indexes for your topic maps so that
you can use the full-text search plug-in (see <a href="#fulltext">section
        3.6.8</a>) to search them.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/fulltext-admin.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 12. The Full-text Indexing Plug-in</b>
</p>


<p>In the screenshot above, most of the topic maps have full-text
indexes. To create an index for one that hasn&rsquo;t, simply press the
<strong>Create index</strong> button and the Omnigator
will create a full-text index for that topic map. The Omnigator will
<em>not</em> index external occurrences referenced from the
topic map, although the full-text system can do that when run from the
command-line.</p>


<p>If the topic maps are changed the indexes will be out of date and
you will get strange results when you try searching. This is because the
full-text index stores the object IDs of the objects indexed, and when
topic maps are loaded from a file the object IDs are assigned
sequentially. If the topic map file changes, so do the object IDs, with
the result that the full-text index will be out of sync with the topic
map. Using the <strong>Reindex</strong> button you can
update the index for any of the topic maps whenever they change.</p>


<p>For information on how to search a topic map, see <a href="#fulltext">section
        3.6.8</a>.</p>




<h3>
<a name="customise-page">3.5. The Customize Page</a>
</h3>



<p>An Ontopia Navigator application such as the Omnigator is built in
three layers, called Model, View, and Skin, respectively.</p>


<p>
<strong>Models</strong> control the set of information that is
extracted from the topic map and placed in each page. The Omnigator is
currently shipped with two models, called &ldquo;Complete&rdquo; (the
default) and &ldquo;Nontopoly&rdquo;. The Complete model, as its name
implies, includes everything that the topic map contains; this includes,
for example, system information from Ontopoly, Ontopia&rsquo;s
ontology-driven editor. The Nontopoly model hides most of this system
information..</p>


<p>
<strong>Views</strong> control the visual structure or layout
of the HTML pages appearing in the client browser. Two views are
currently shipped: &ldquo;No frames&rdquo; (a two-column layout), and
&ldquo;Single column&rdquo; (for use with limited screen real estate,
e.g. in portlets and on PDAs, in conjunction with the
&ldquo;Compact&rdquo; skin).</p>


<p>
<strong>Skins</strong> are CSS stylesheets that
control the styling of a page, i.e., improving its detailed appearance
in browsers that support CSS. The Omnigator ships with two style
sheets, some tasteful, others less so. (Feel free to try creating your
own and send us the results!)</p>


<p>Clicking on the <strong>Customize</strong> button
from anywhere in the Omnigator brings up the <dfn>Customize

<h3>
<a name="plug-ins">3.6. The Plug-ins</a>
</h3>



<p>Plug-ins are a general concept that allows extra functionality to
be dropped into any Navigator application by simply adding files to a
directory. One example of how this could be used is to add a topic map
visualisation application into the Omnigator. This section describes
some of the plug-ins that are shipped with the product.</p>


<p>How to develop your own Omnigator plug-ins is described in this
document: <a href="plugins.html">The
Ontopia Navigator, Plug-ins Developer's Guide</a>.</p>


<h4>
<a name="edit-page">3.6.1. The Edit plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>The Edit plug-in allows you to edit your topic map using
Ontopia&rsquo;s new ontology-driven editor, Ontopoly. What happens when
you click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button depends on whether
the topic map contains Ontopoly system information or not, i.e., whether
or not it is an <dfn>Ontopoly topic map</dfn>. Any topic map
created in (or imported to) Ontopoly will have such information; all
others will not.</p>


<p>If you choose to edit an Ontopoly topic map you will either be
taken to Ontopoly&rsquo;s Instance Indexes Page (if you start from an
Omnigator Index Page), to the appropriate Instance Page (if you start
from the Topic Page of an instance topic), or to the appropriate
Configuration Page (if you start from the Topic Page of a typing
topic).</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/Ontopoly.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 14. Editing an instance with Ontopoly</b>
</p>


<p>If you attempt to edit one of Ontopoly&rsquo;s system topics
(e.g., 'Field order'), you will be taken to the Instance Indexes
Page.</p>


<p>If you choose to edit an non-Ontopoly topic map you will be
informed about the need to convert the topic map and given the choice of
either updating the existing topic map or creating a new one. Once you
have made your choice, Ontopoly will infer an ontology and schema from
the topic map and take you to its Ontology Index Page for topic types so
that you can inspect the ontology before proceeding to edit the topic
map.</p>


<p>(While we are on the subject of Ontopoly, you may be interested to
know that it is possible to hide the system information when browsing an
Ontopoly topic map. To find out how, see <a href="#customise-page">section
        3.5</a>. For a complete introduction to Ontopoly, see
the <a href="../../../ontopoly/doc/user-guide.html">Ontopoly
User&rsquo;s Guide</a>.</p>



<h4>
<a name="set-context-page">3.6.2. The Filter plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>This plug-in allows you to customize your view of the topic map by
establishing a <dfn>context</dfn> within which the scope of
topic characteristics is evaluated. You do this by simply specifying the
themes (i.e., scoping topics) you are interested in via the
<dfn>Set Context Page</dfn>.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/SetContextPage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 15. The Set Context Page</b>
</p>


<p>Clicking on the <strong>Filter</strong> button
brings up the Set Context Page. Here themes are grouped in two levels:
first according to whether they are used to scope names, associations,
or occurrences; and then by axis. Axes are determined automatically
based on the classes to which themes belong. (Themes that don&rsquo;t belong
to any class are grouped along an axis labelled <strong>[unspecified]</strong>.)</p>


<p>Context themes are currently used for two purposes:
<em>selecting</em> (i.e., choosing the most relevant name),
and <em>filtering</em> (i.e., removing unwanted associations
and occurrences).</p>


<p>Since name context is used for selection, it usually makes sense
to only specify one name theme (at most) from each axis. Once you have
set your preferences, the application will endeavour to use the most
appropriate name based on whatever themes you have specified. To test
this using the <em>Italian Opera Topic Map</em>, go to
Puccini&rsquo;s opera <em>La fanciulla del West</em>, click on the
<strong>Filter</strong> button, set your language preference
(under Name Context) to English, and press
<strong>Activate</strong>. You will be returned to the same Topic
Page, but now the name of the topic has changed to "The Girl of
the Golden West".</p>


<p>Association context and occurrence context is used differently. In
this case, the more themes you specify, the more associations and
occurrences will be shown (unless you don&rsquo;t specify any themes, in
which case all the associations and occurrences will be shown). To test
this functionality, return to 'Puccini' and take careful note of the
number of <strong>Associations</strong> and
<strong>Occurrences</strong>. Now click on the <strong>Filter</strong> button and set your preferences to
'Biography' (for association context) and 'Italian' (for occurrence
context). Click <strong>Activate</strong> and compare the results.
You should see only three association types ('Born in', 'Died in', and
'Pupil of', all biographical) and a shorter list of occurrences.</p>


<p>Scope is a powerful mechanism but the ISO standard and the XTM
specification neither specify nor constrain the ways in which it might
be used. Since the Omnigator is designed to work across a wide range of
topic maps, the implementation of selection and filtering by scope is
based on certain general principles:</p>


<ol>
<li>

<p>A distinction is made between <dfn>principal
themes</dfn> and <dfn>incidental themes</dfn>. Only
principal themes are shown for selection on the Filter Page, otherwise
the task of choosing among them would be difficult, to say the least.
(The <em>Italian Opera Topic Map</em> uses over 70 topics as
themes, but only half of them appear on the Set Context Page.)</p>

<p>A principal theme is one that the author has deliberately employed
in order to provide different kinds of topic names (e.g., in different
languages) for use in different contexts, or to provide ways of reducing
the number of associations or occurrences. An incidental theme, on the
other hand, is one whose sole purpose is to disambiguate topic names
(i.e., to avoid the topic naming constraint), or some other specific
purpose that is under the control of the application rather than the
user.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>The Omnigator only uses context to govern the
<em>selection</em> of names (in situations in which just
one name is required), and the <em>filtering</em> of
associations and occurrences.</p>

<p>When a name context is specified, the name whose scope has the
most themes in common with the context is selected. (If there are no
names whose scope contains a context theme, a name in the unconstrained
scope is used, if it exists. If not, a name is chosen at random.)</p>

<p>When an association or occurrence context is specified, only
associations and occurrences that have at least one theme in common with
the context are allowed through the filter (along with any that are in
the unconstrained scope).</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Themes are grouped on the Set Context Page along <em>axes of
scope</em>, according to the classes to which they belong. (The
concept of axes was introduced in the paper <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/scope.htm">Towards a
General Theory of Scope</a>, available at the Ontopia web
site.)</p>

<p>In the current version of the Omnigator the only purpose of axes
is to provide a less cluttered user interface. However, later versions
may exploit this concept to provide more powerful filtering
capabilities. Topic map authors are therefore advised to follow what in
any case is a sound design principle: Ensure that any topics used as
themes have explicit types.</p>

</li>
</ol>




<h4>
<a name="N1056D">3.6.3. The Merge plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>This plug-in (which is not available in the online demo) allows
you to merge a second topic map with the current one, or suppress
duplicates in the current topic map. Clicking on the <strong>Merge</strong> button takes you to a page with a scroll
box from which you can choose any of the topic maps registered with the
system (except the current topic map). After merging you can browse the
resulting topic map.</p>


<p>The <strong>Also do name-based merging</strong> checkbox allows you to control
whether or not topics with the same base names in the same scope will be
merged in accordance with the topic naming constraint. If you don&rsquo;t want
the system to enforce the topic naming constraint, leave this box
unchecked.</p>


<p>Whatever your setting for the name based merging option, topics
will be merged if they have the same subject identifier or subject
locator. In addition, duplicate names, associations, and occurrences
<em>that arise as a result of the merge</em> will be
removed.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/MergePage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 16. The Merge Page</b>
</p>


<p>Duplicates in the source topic maps will be treated in accordance
with the settings for performing duplicate suppression when loading a
topic map. The default is for no duplicate suppression to be performed.
(This allows the Omnigator to be used as a debugger and also speeds up
loading.) The default can be overridden by modifying the
duplicateSuppression properties in the
<tt>tm-sources.xml</tt> file. If you have loaded a topic map
with duplicate suppression switched off and want to remove any
duplicates that it might contain, simply click on the 'Suppress' button
on the Merging and Duplicate Suppression page.</p>


<p>
<strong>TIP:</strong> A useful trick for testing
the consistency of your topic map is to merge it with itself and compare
the statistics of the result with those of the original. Put two copies
of your topic map in the <tt>{Ontopia}/topicmaps/</tt> directory
under different names, and <strong>Refresh Sources</strong> from the Manage Page. Load
one of them and run the Statistics plug-in. Open the same topic map in a
new browser window and merge it with the copy using the Merge plug-in.
(Note the way that the URL of the resulting merged topic map contains
the names of both the source topic maps.) Run the Statistics plug-in on
the merged topic map and compare the results with the statistics of the
first topic map. Any discrepancies between the two could indicate
inconsistencies or redundancies in your topic map.</p>




<h4>
<a name="N105A2">3.6.4. The Export plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>This plug-in creates a serialisation of the current topic map in
XTM, LTM, TM/XML, or RDF syntax and allows you to either save it
directly to a disk file or load it as XML into your browser. Some of
the situations in which you might want to use it are:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>you have loaded a topic map in one format and want to write it
out in another;</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>you have merged two or more topic maps and want to persist
the result; or</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>you have modified the topic map in some way (for example,
via a plug-in) and want to save the result.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>When exporting back to the same format as the source format, the
exporter does not preserve white space, comments, or the ordering of
elements. However, it <em>does</em> preserve XML IDs, except
when merging has been performed (either by <tt>&lt;mergeMap&gt;</tt>
or the Merge plug-in), or when the IDs in question have the form
<tt class="symbol">id#</tt>, where <tt class="symbol">#</tt> is a number.</p>


<p>When topic maps have been merged, the uniqueness of IDs can no
longer be guaranteed. The exporter will therefore only preserve IDs that
originated in the base topic map; IDs that originated in topic maps
merged into the base topic map will be replaced by automatically
generated IDs of the form <tt class="symbol">id#</tt>, where <tt class="symbol">#</tt>
is a decimal number. In order to prevent clashes, IDs that have the form
<tt class="symbol">id#</tt>; in the source topic map are never
preserved.</p>


<p>The Export plug-in also allows you to generate a basic schema for
your topic map, expressed in <a href="../schema/tutorial.html">Ontopia Schema Language (OSL)</a>.
That schema can then be further refined by hand and used to validate the
original topic map or other topic maps that conform to the same
ontology.</p>




<h4>
<a name="rdf2tm-plug-in">3.6.5. The RDF2TM plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>This plug-in provides an easy point-and-click interface for
configuring RDF2TM mappings as described in <a href="#rdf-support">section
        3.1</a>. Specify the desired mapping for each property
using the selection box and press Confirm to accept proposed and/or
changed mappings.</p>


<p>Each RDF property can be mapped to a characteristic (a basename,
occurrence, or association) or to an identifier (subject identifier,
subject locator, or source locator); or else it can be ignored.</p>


<p>A table of existing mappings (usually <tt>mapping.rdff</tt>
in the Omnigator&rsquo;s <tt>topicmaps</tt> directory) is used to
record mappings for later use.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/RDF2TMPage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 17. The RDF2TM Mapping Page</b>
</p>


<p>When the Omnigator encounters a property for which no mapping exists
it makes a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; proposal based on the kinds of values exhibited
by the property: Properties whose values are literals are mapped to
occurrences; those whose values are URIrefs or blank nodes are mapped to
associations. These proposed mappings can sometimes be improved as
follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>Some properties whose values are literals (e.g. dc:title) are
more appropriately mapped to basenames (or scoped basenames).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some properties whose values are URIs (e.g. foaf:homepage) are
more appropriately mapped to (external) occurrences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other properties whose values are URIs (e.g.
skos:subjectIndicator) might be more appropriately mapped to an
identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Properties are used to type the resulting occurrences and
associations, or to scope basenames. Thus, for example, dc:description
properties mapped to occurrences will result in occurrences of type
dc:description; foaf:knows properties mapped to associations will
result in associations of type foaf:knows; and foaf:nick properties
mapped to scoped basenames will result in basenames scoped by
foaf:nick.</p>


<p>The role types of associations are set to the predefined subjects
rdf2tm:subject and rdf2tm:object (where rdf2tm is the namespace
&lt;http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/&gt;).</p>


<p>The technical details of this mapping are described in an
<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/rdf2tm.html">Ontopia
Technical Report</a>. Ontopia is currently leading a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/RDFTM/">Task Force</a>
within the Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group of
the W3C to create guidelines for RDF/Topic Maps Interoperability.</p>



<h4>
<a name="query-plug-in">3.6.6. The Query plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>The Query plug-in lets you perform queries on your topic map using
the <em>tolog</em> query language. Clicking on the
<strong>Query</strong> button brings up a page with a text entry
box in which you write your query using tolog syntax. (For most of the
topic maps delivered with the Omnigator you can also choose one or more
example queries from a drop-down list.) For example, using the
<tt>opera.ltm</tt> topic map you might enter the following
query:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Sample tolog query</b>
</p>


<code>
<pre>select $COMPOSER, count($OPERA) from
composed-by($OPERA : opera, $COMPOSER : composer)
order by $OPERA desc?</pre>
</code>



<p>This query finds all operas and composers and then returns a list
of composers and the number of operas they composed, sorted in
descending order (i.e., from highest to lowest):</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/tologresults.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 18. Results of the sample tolog query</b>
</p>


<p>Tolog is a structured query language for topic maps developed by
Ontopia. Its role with respect to topic maps is the same as SQL&rsquo;s role
with respect to relational databases: It both simplifies application
development and offers much more efficient data retrieval. Tolog has
been proposed as a candidate for Topic Maps Query Language, the standard
query language being developed by the ISO Topic Maps working group. For
a more detailed description, refer to the <a href="../query/tutorial.html">Query Language Tutorial</a>.</p>




<h4>
<a name="validate-plug-in">3.6.7. The Validate plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>The Validate plug-in lets you check the validity of your topic map
against an OSL <em>(Ontopia Schema Language)</em> schema. If
you have such a schema for your topic map, clicking on the
<strong>Validate</strong> button will cause the topic map to be
validated and any constraint violations to be displayed on a new page.
(If you don&rsquo;t already have a schema, you can generate a skeletal
one from your topic map via the Export plug-in.)</p>


<p>OSL is a constraint language for topic maps developed by Ontopia.
It was created both to provide input to the process of developing a
standard Topic Maps Constraint Language in the ISO Topic Maps working
group and to fulfill urgent customer needs. (In addition to validation,
a schema makes it possible to optimize applications and build more
intuitive user interfaces.) The Omnigator distribution includes complete
schema for the Scripts and Languages topic map
(<tt>i18n.ltm.osl</tt>) and a partial schema for the Italian
Opera Topic Map (<tt>opera.ltm.osl</tt>), both of which
reside in the
<tt>{Ontopia}/topicmaps</tt>
directory. (Note that the Opera topic map schema may cause some errors
to be reported during validation depending on the current state of
experimentation. If so, regard it as being intentional!)</p>


<p>For a more detailed description of OSL, refer to the <a href="../schema/tutorial.html">Schema Language Tutorial</a>.</p>




<h4>
<a name="fulltext">3.6.8. The Full-text Search Plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p> The Full-text Search Plug-in allows you to do simple full-text
searches in your topic maps. Topic names and occurrences are searched
using a pre-built full-text index. This index can be created using the
Full-text indexing Plug-in (described in <a href="#fulltext-admin">section
        3.4</a>.) When a full-text index has been created for
a topic map, a search box will show up in the plug-ins line (seen to the
right of the <strong>Search</strong> link in the screenshot in
<a href="#tm-page">section
        2.2</a>). If no index exists, the button will read
<strong>Not indexed</strong> and will link to the Fulltext Index Administration
page.</p>


<p>Entering a search text here and pressing enter will get you to the
page that displays the full-text search results. These are a list of
links to the topics you found, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/fulltext-result.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 19. Full-text search result</b>
</p>


<p> In this screenshot we have searched for &ldquo;Tosca&rdquo; in the
<cite>Italian Opera Topic Map</cite>, and the plug-in is
showing us all the matches it has found. In this case the matches were
all in the base names of topics, and we have found the opera &ldquo;Tosca&rdquo;,
the character &ldquo;Floria Tosca&rdquo;, the play &ldquo;La Tosca&rdquo;, the aria &ldquo;Va,
Tosca!&rdquo;, and the topic &ldquo;The setting of Tosca in Rome&rdquo; (a reification of
the association between Tosca and Rome). Clicking on any of these will
take us to that particular topic. Note how the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; of the
topic map shows through here: Even a simple thing like a full-text
search becomes a dialog between the user and the system, where the user
says &ldquo;Tosca&rdquo; and the system responds &ldquo;I know these Toscas, which one did
you mean?&rdquo;</p>


<p>Full-text search is very effective when you want to jump directly
to a specific topic, or see if some concept is mentioned anywhere in the
topic map. Combined with the browsing interface it makes the task of
locating information much simpler.</p>



<h4>
<a name="N106A8">3.6.9. The Statistics plug-in</a>
</h4>



<p>This plug-in is a report generator for topic maps. It provides an
overview of the map&rsquo;s &ldquo;vital statistics&rdquo; and a detailed breakdown of
some of its structures. Surprisingly often this information can be used
to reveal inconsistencies or other problems with the topic map.</p>


<p align="center">


<img align="center" src="graphics/StatisticsPage.png" width="75%">
</p>
<p align="center">
<b>Figure 20. The Statistics Page</b>
</p>


<p>Most of the <dfn>Statistics Page</dfn> speaks for
itself but it is worth pointing out some of the details. Under the
heading <strong>Association structure summary</strong> is a list of association types
broken down according to the roles that are played in those
associations. Some association types only appear once (e.g., 'Born in',
with the roles 'Person' and 'Place'). Others may appear more than once
(e.g., 'Killed by'); when this happens it is due to different
combinations of roles, which may either be perfectly legitimate (as in
this case), or the result of an error in the topic map.</p>


<p>Note also that there are links from the typing topics (e.g.
'Aria') straight to the Topic Page for that topic, and also links from
the numbers in the second column to more detailed statistics on the
particular typing topic in question.</p>










<h2>
<a name="tutorial">4. Building Your Own Topic Map</a>
</h2>



<p>This section provides a simple step by step tutorial for creating
a (small) topicmap in XTM (XML Topic Maps) syntax and loading it into
your local copy of the Omnigator. You may be surprised just how easy it
is. Since you will be typing in XML data, we assume some minimal
familiarity with start-tags, end-tags, and attributes, as used in SGML,
XML, and HTML, but that's about as hard as it gets.</p>


<p>In following the tutorial, you can of course cheat by copying and
pasting the markup examples instead of typing everything in by hand. Our
advice, though, is to do it the hard way. Nothing beats laboriously
typing in angle brackets if you really want to understand the syntax
(and, by extension, the concepts themselves). You will make mistakes
&ndash; but you will also learn from them!</p>


<p>There are two alternatives to typing in angle brackets. One is
to develop a custom editing environment based on the Ontopia Web
Editor Framework. That way you can build a forms-based interface which
completely hides the fact that you are creating a topic map. But since
the whole point of this exercise is to gain a deeper understanding of
topic maps, we suggest you save that option for later. The other
alternative, if you need to create and maintain large topic maps
manually, is to investigate the <em>Linear Topic Map notation
(LTM)</em>, which is another of the input formats supported by
the Ontopia Topic Map Engine. It is vastly more compact than XTM!
(Documentation of LTM is included in all Ontopia distributions and can
also be found at <a href="http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html">http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html</a>).</p>


<h3>
<a name="N106E3">4.1. Step 1: Determining scope and basic ontology</a>
</h3>



<p>Before you start, you need to have a rough idea of what it is that
you want to represent in your topic map. There are two parts to this:
delimiting the scope of the topic map &ndash; that is, deciding the
extent of the domain it should cover; and designing the basic ontology.
In Topic Maps terminology, an ontology is a precise description of the
kinds of things which are found in the domain covered by the topic map:
in other words, the set of topics that are used to define classes of
topics, associations, roles, and occurrences. (The term "ontology" is
also used in other fields, such as philosophy, where it has other
meanings. You may also encounter it used to include constraints as well
as a specification of classes.) In Topic Maps it is easy to extend the
ontology, so you don't have to decide everything up front.</p>


<p>To make things easy we have chosen a subject domain that ought
to appeal to you. The subject is <em>you</em> and the
company you work for (or may one day work for). The scope can easily
be extended to cover your colleagues, the projects in which you are
involved, the products your company builds or services it provides,
etc. In the examples that follow, we will assume that your name is
Jill Hacker, and that you are a developer working for Ontopia. The
basic ontology therefore consists of the topic types 'Developer' and
'Company', the association type 'Employed by', and the roles
'Employee' and 'Employer'.</p>




<h3>
<a name="step2">4.2. Step 2: Getting the framework in place</a>
</h3>



<p>To start with, here is the simplest possible valid topic map in
XTM syntax. It is empty, but it does at least declare itself to be a
topic map in XTM syntax with a specific character encoding. (If you
leave out the encoding attribute, UTF-8 will be assumed.)</p>


<p align="center">
<b>The simplest possible topic map</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;topicMap xmlns="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
&lt;/topicMap&gt;
</pre>



<p>To see this topic map in the Omnigator, type it in (no
cheating!) using your favourite text editor (e.g., emacs, TextPad,
Notepad, etc.), and save it under a name with the extension
<tt>.xtm</tt> in the appropriate directory. (By default
this is
<tt>{Ontopia}/topicmaps/</tt>.</p>


<p>Once the topic map file is in the correct place, start the
Omnigator, go to the Manage Page, and there you will see your XTM
document among the Registry Items. (If the Omnigator was already
running you will need to click on "Refresh Sources" in order to get
your topic map to appear in the list.) Now click on "Load". Assuming
no parsing errors occur, the document will be loaded and its name will
become a link.</p>


<p>If you get parsing errors, you will need to go back and fix the
document. Look for missing quotes, misspelt tag names, wrong use of
case, etc. If you get the error message "No topic maps in document", it
means you have made a mistake in the namespace declaration, or have a
misspelling in the <tt>&lt;topicMap&gt;</tt> start-tag.</p>


<p>Once your topic map has been successfully loaded, click on its
name and you will be taken to the Index Page. Not surprisingly, you
won't see very much, either in the "Ontology", the "Master Index", or
the "Themes" view, but at least you have the topic map in the
Omnigator! Now is the time to start adding topics.</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1071A">4.3. Step 3: Creating the first topic</a>
</h3>



<p>If you were going about the creation of this topic map in a
methodical way, you would first create all the typing topics and then
create instances of them. However, doing things in the wrong order can
sometimes be quite instructive, so that is what we will do! Add a single
topic &ndash; yourself &ndash; to the topic map:</p>

<p align="center">
<b>A one-topic topic map</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;topicMap xmlns="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;

&lt;topic id="jill"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill Hacker&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;/topicMap&gt;
</pre>



<p>Pay careful attention to the case of your tag names (it is
"baseName", not "basename"). Also note that the ID ("jill") is not
significant; it can be any valid XML ID. Save the file, go to the
Omnigator, and click on the <strong>Reload</strong>
button. Assuming no errors, the topic map will be reloaded and you will
be returned to the Index Page.</p>


<p>Once again there is nothing in the ontology view. Don't be
alarmed: An ontology consists of topics that represent classes or types
and you don't have any yet. All you have is an individual (yourself).
However, if you now choose "Master Index" from the pull-down list you
will notice a difference. (You may have to use the browser's Reload
command, normally <tt class="symbol">Ctrl-R</tt> or <tt class="symbol">F5</tt>, if
your browser is doing caching. In fact, you might want to switch caching
off while doing these exercises: Every time you modify your topic map
you run the risk that the internal IDs will have changed, and this can
cause confusion.)</p>


<p>What you should see in the master index view is a single topic,
Jill Hacker. If you click on it, you are taken to the Topic Page where
you see that this topic has just one characteristic: its name.</p>



<h3>
<a name="N1073F">4.4. Step 4: Adding a topic type</a>
</h3>



<p>Now let's give this topic a type by adding an
<tt>&lt;instanceOf&gt;</tt> subelement:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A topic map with an (erroneously) typed topic</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;topicMap xmlns="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;

&lt;topic id="jill"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#developer"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill Hacker&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;/topicMap&gt;
</pre>



<p>This example is incomplete, since it references a topic
('Developer') that does not yet exist. But the Omnigator is quite
forgiving in situations like this and simply instantiates an unnamed
topic, as you will see if you reload your topic map. In the Ontology
view you will now see that topic (with the name "[No name]" under the
under the heading "Index of Topic Types". If you click on it, you are
taken to a Topic Page for this topic type and you will see yourself in
the list of "Topics of this Type". On the Index Page you will also see a
link for "Unnamed Topics".</p>


<p>Now let's create a real 'Developer' topic, and while we're at it,
topics for the company 'Ontopia' and the topic type 'Company':</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A topic map with two correctly typed topics</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;topicMap xmlns="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;

&lt;topic id="jill"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#developer"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill Hacker&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="developer"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Developer&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="ontopia"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#company"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Ontopia&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="company"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Company&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;/topicMap&gt;
</pre>



<p>When you reload your topic map you will see that the ontology now
consists of two topics, and that there are four topics in the master
index. There should now be no "Unnamed Topics". (If there are, you
screwed up!) So far, so good. Now for the next step.</p>




<h3>
<a name="adding-occurrences">4.5. Step 5: Adding occurrences</a>
</h3>



<p>Adding occurrences is a simple matter, as the following examples
show (look for the <tt>&lt;occurrence&gt;</tt> elements):</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Topics with occurrences</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="ontopia"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#company"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Ontopia&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;occurrence&gt;
    &lt;instanceOf&gt;
      &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#website"/&gt;
    &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;resourceRef xlink:href="http://www.ontopia.net/"/&gt;
  &lt;/occurrence&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="jill"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#developer"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill Hacker&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;occurrence&gt;
    &lt;instanceOf&gt;
      &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#kudo"/&gt;
    &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;resourceData&gt;Jill's a cool girl and a great hacker&lt;/resourceData&gt;
  &lt;/occurrence&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="website"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Web site&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="kudo"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Kudo&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>



<p>The occurrence for Ontopia <em>points to</em> an
external resource (using a <tt>&lt;resourceRef&gt;</tt>
element with a URL as the address), while the occurrence for you,
'Jill', <em>contains</em> an internal resource (in the
form of a <tt>&lt;resourceData&gt;</tt> element). Note also
that we need to add topics for the occurrence types 'Website' and
'Kudo' in order to avoid more "[No name]" topics.</p>




<h3>
<a name="using-PSIs">4.6. Step 6: Identification of subjects</a>
</h3>



<p>One of the unique features of Topic Maps is its identity model,
which allows arbitrary topic maps to be merged without the problems
usually occasioned by homonyms and synonyms. To take full advantage of
this feature, you are encouraged to define identifiers for your topics.
This can be done in one of two ways, both of which involve the use of
URIs.</p>


<p>The preferred approach is to define a URI (called a "subject
identifier") that resolves to a resource (called a "subject indicator")
that provides a human with a compelling <em>indication</em>
of the subject's identity. For the topic 'Ontopia', that might look like
this:
</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A topic with a subject identifier</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="ontopia"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#company"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;subjectIdentity&gt;
    &lt;subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="http://psi.ontopia.net/ontopia/#ontopia"/&gt;
  &lt;/subjectIdentity&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Ontopia&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>



<p>Subject identifiers can be used for absolutely any kind of
subject. However, if the subject that the topic represents is an
<em>information resource</em> (such as a web page), the
address of the resource can also be used as an identifier, in which case
it is called a <em>subject locator</em>:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>A topic with a subject locator</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="ontopias-website"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#website"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;subjectIdentity&gt;
    &lt;resourceRef xlink:href="http://www.ontopia.net/"/&gt;
  &lt;/subjectIdentity&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Ontopia's Web Site&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>



<p>Note, by the way, how adding this topic changes the way in which
the web site occurrence is displayed on the page for the topic
'Ontopia': Instead of the URL, the name "Ontopia's Web Site" is shown.
This is because the Omnigator now has a name for the resource whose URL
is "http://www.ontopia.net/".</p>




<h3>
<a name="adding-associations">4.7. Step 7: Adding associations</a>
</h3>



<p>Having by now become an expert on topics, occurrences, and
identifiers, it is time to add an association asserting that you work
for Ontopia. (You never know your luck!) The association will look like
this:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>An association element</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;association&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employment"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;member&gt;
    &lt;roleSpec&gt;&lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employee"/&gt;&lt;/roleSpec&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#jill"/&gt;
  &lt;/member&gt;
  &lt;member&gt;
    &lt;roleSpec&gt;&lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employer"/&gt;&lt;/roleSpec&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#ontopia"/&gt;
  &lt;/member&gt;
&lt;/association&gt;
</pre>



<p>This association element contains references to three topics that
we don't yet have in our topic map: 'Employer' and 'Employee' (the
association role types) and 'Employment' (the association type). If you
insert it as is, without adding these three topics, you will get more
"[no name]" topics in the Omnigator. Try it if you like and see.</p>


<p>The three new topics you need to add could look like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Association type and association role type topics</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="employment"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Employment&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;&lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employer"/&gt;&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Employs&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;&lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employee"/&gt;&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Employed by&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="employer"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Employer&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;topic id="employee"&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Employee&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

</pre>



<p>Look carefully at the 'Employment' topic that defines the
association type. We have given it three base names: one (a noun,
"employment") in the unconstrained scope, which serves as the default
name used to characterise the relationship type, and two others (the
verb forms "Employs" and "Employed by") in the scope 'Employer' and
'Employee' respectively.</p>


<p>Is it necessary to do this? No. But the advantage is that it
enables an application like the Omnigator to choose the most
appropriate label for the association type depending on the
context:</p>


<ul>
<li>

<p>When the association type itself is the current topic, the name in
the unconstrained scope ("employment") will be chosen.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>When associations of this type are being viewed from the vantage
point of a topic playing the role 'Employer' (e.g., when Ontopia is the
current topic), the name in the scope 'Employer' ("Employs") will be
chosen.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>When associations of this type are being viewed from the vantage
point of a topic playing the role 'Employee' (e.g., when the current
topic is you), the name in the scope 'Employee' ("Employed by") will be
chosen.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a simple but effective use of scope that helps overcome
the conflict between the fact that relationships (as expressed by
associations in topic maps) have no direction, and the fact that the
serialisation syntax used to <em>talk about</em>
relationships (natural language) often <em>does</em> have a
direction (for example, subject-verb-object in most Western European
languages). To test the intuitiveness of this technique, load the
complete topic map into the Omnigator and go back and forth between the
topics you ('Jill') and 'Ontopia', noting how the label for the
relationship changes depending on the role played by the current
topic.</p>




<h3>
<a name="reification">4.8. Step 8: Reification</a>
</h3>



<p>Before letting you loose on your own, there is one final, slightly
tricky concept that you should try your hand at. It's called
<dfn>reification</dfn>. Don't be put off by the name; the
basic concept is really quite simple. Reification in general is about
turning something into a "thing" ("re" in Latin); it could also be
called "thingification".</p>


<p>In Topic Maps, reification means taking a topic map construct,
e.g., an association, occurrence, or even the topic map itself, and
turning it into a topic, in order to be able to make assertions about
it. How is it done in XTM? It's quite simple. There are two
steps:</p>


<ol>
<li>

<p>Give the element representing the topic map object you want to
reify an ID.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Create a topic whose subject identity has a subject indicator
reference to that element.</p>

</li>
</ol>


<p>Piece of cake, right? So let's try it. Start by reifying the topic
map. Modify your <tt>&lt;topicMap&gt;</tt> start-tag by adding
an ID, and create a topic that references the topic map element as its
subject indicator:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Reifying the topic map</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;topicMap id="jillstm"
          xmlns="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;

&lt;!-- other topics and associations omitted for brevity --&gt;

&lt;topic id="jillstm-topic"&gt;
  &lt;subjectIdentity&gt;
    &lt;subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="#jillstm"/&gt;
  &lt;/subjectIdentity&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill's First Topic Map&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;

&lt;/topicMap&gt;
</pre>



<p>When you load this topic map into the Omnigator, you will see that
the name of the topic that reifies the topic map ("Jill's First Topic
Map") is used as the title of the Index Page, and also replaces the
<strong>Index Page</strong> button. If you feel this
text is a bit long to use as a button, you can give the same topic a
second name, this time in a specific <em>scope</em> that
will be preferred by the Omnigator:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Giving the topic map a short name</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="jillstm-topic"&gt;
  &lt;subjectIdentity&gt;
    &lt;subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="#jillstm"/&gt;
  &lt;/subjectIdentity&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill's First Topic Map&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;
      &lt;subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="http://psi.ontopia.net/basename/#short-name"/&gt;
    &lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill's 1st TM&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>



<p>Now let's reify an association.</p>


<p>Why would you want to do that? Well, you might want to say
something more about the relationship asserted by an association, over
and above its type and roles &ndash; and the only way to "say
something" about <em>anything</em> in Topic Maps Land is by
making that thing into a topic. For example, you might have information
resources that pertain to your relationship with Ontopia, such as your
contract, terms of employment, assessments, or whatever. By reifying the
association, you obtain a topic on which to hang these resources as
occurrences, like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<b>Reifying an association</b>
</p>


<pre>&lt;topic id="jill-ontopia-topic"&gt;
  &lt;instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#employment"/&gt;
  &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
  &lt;subjectIdentity&gt;
    &lt;subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="#jill-ontopia-association"/&gt;
  &lt;/subjectIdentity&gt;
  &lt;baseName&gt;
    &lt;baseNameString&gt;Jill's position with Ontopia&lt;/baseNameString&gt;
  &lt;/baseName&gt;
  &lt;occurrence&gt;
    &lt;instanceOf&gt;
      &lt;topicRef xlink:href="#contract"/&gt;
    &lt;/instanceOf&gt;
    &lt;resourceRef
      xlink:href="http://www.ontopia.net/internal/employees/contracts/jill.htm"/&gt;
  &lt;/occurrence&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>



<p>We haven't shown how to add the ID
(<tt class="symbol">jill-ontopia-association</tt>) to the association that we
created in Step 7; we assume you can add that yourself. (If you can't,
you are allowed to cheat by looking at the complete example at the end
of this document) We also assume that by now you can create a topic for
'Contract'.</p>


<p>You'll see the result when you reload the topic map: The
association between you and Ontopia now has a <em><strong>more...</strong></em> link which will take you to
the topic that represents the association. That association has its own
occurrence (your contract with Ontopia), and there is a section labelled
"Reification Topics", under which you will see the topics (you and
'Ontopia') that participate in the reified association.</p>


<p>Since a reified association is also a topic, it can have its own
characteristics. Yours already has a name and an occurrence. It could
also play roles in associations with other topics, and those
associations could themselves be reified. This leads to a multilayered
topic map that can be browsed at varying levels of detail. A user can
start at the topic level, and then "zoom in" on an association or other
characteristic that is of particular interest and get a new level of
detail.</p>


<p>The Omnigator also supports reification of occurrences, base
names, and variant names, but we'll leave it to you to experiment with
these.</p>




<h3>
<a name="metadata">4.9. Step 9: Adding metadata to your topic map</a>
</h3>



<p>Now that you know how to reify the topic map it is easy to add
metadata describing properties such as creator, date, description,
publisher, etc. These properties will then be displayed on the Index
Page in a box labelled "Topic Map Metadata". Most of the topic maps that
are distributed with the Omnigator have examples of such metadata. We
recommend using the Dublin Core vocabulary in the manner shown in the
version of <tt>jill.xtm</tt> included in the
distribution.</p>




<h3>
<a name="N10872">4.10. Step 10: Over to you</a>
</h3>



<p>From this point there are many directions in which you could take
your topic map. For example, you could extend the ontology to include
departments and projects, and the kinds of relationships that exist
between them and your existing categories. Or you can add your
colleagues, create new associations and occurrences, or provide more
names in different scopes to those topics that already exist. Now you
know the syntax you could also autogenerate topic maps from existing
structured information (e.g., an LDAP database) and merge it with topic
maps you have created by hand.</p>


<p>If you are going to continue maintaining the topic map by hand for
the time being, you should seriously consider using LTM syntax rather
than XTM. It is vastly more compact and much easier to work with. (Don't
worry about it not being a standard syntax because you can always
convert it to XTM using the Export plug-in.)</p>


<p>The possibilities are almost unlimited. We hope that this tutorial
has been useful in getting you started with your own topic maps. If you
decide that this paradigm is the way to go for you and your
organisation, feel free to contact Ontopia for more advice, to book our
training courses, license our software, or get in touch with our
